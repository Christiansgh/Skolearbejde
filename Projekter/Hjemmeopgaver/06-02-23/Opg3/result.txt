                               STRANGE CASE OF                               DR JEKYLL AND                                  MR HYDE                                     BY                            ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON                             STORY OF THE DOORMR UTTERSON the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that wasnever lighted by a smile cold scanty and embarrassed indiscourse backward in sentiment lean long dusty dreary andyet somehow lovable At friendly meetings and when the wine was tohis taste something eminently human beaconed from his eyesomething indeed which never found its way into his talk but whichspoke not only in these silent symbols of the afterdinner face butmore often and loudly in the acts of his life He was austere withhimself drank gin when he was alone to mortify a taste forvintages and though he enjoyed the theatre had not crossed thedoors of one for twenty years But he had an approved tolerance forothers sometimes wondering almost with envy at the high pressureof spirits involved in their misdeeds and in any extremity inclinedto help rather than to reproveI incline to Cains heresy he used to say quaintly I let mybrother go to the devil in his own way In this character it wasfrequently his fortune to be the last reputable acquaintance and thelast good influence in the lives of downgoing men And to such asthese so long as they came about his chambers he never marked ashade of change in his demeanourNo doubt the feat was easy to Mr Utterson for he wasundemonstrative at the best and even his friendship seemed to befounded in a similar catholicity of goodnature It is the mark of amodest man to accept his friendly circle readymade from the handsof opportunity and that was the lawyers way His friends werethose of his own blood or those whom he had known the longest hisaffections like ivy were the growth of time they implied noaptness in the object Hence no doubt the bond that united him toMr Richard Enfield his distant kinsman the wellknown man abouttown It was a nut to crack for many what these two could see ineach other or what subject they could find in common It wasreported by those who encountered them in their Sunday walks thatthey said nothing looked singularly dull and would hail withobvious relief the appearance of a friend For all that the two menput the greatest store by these excursions counted them the chiefjewel of each week and not only set aside occasions of pleasurebut even resisted the callsof business that they might enjoy them uninterruptedIt chanced on one of these rambles that their way led them down abystreet in a busy quarter of London The street was small andwhat is called quiet but it drove a thriving trade on theweekdays The inhabitants were all doing well it seemed and allemulously hoping to do better still and laying out the surplus oftheir gains in coquetry so that the shop fronts stood along thatthoroughfare with an air of invitation like rows of smilingsaleswomen Even on Sunday when it veiled its more florid charmsand lay comparatively empty of passage the street shone out incontrast to its dingy neighbourhood like a fire in a forest andwith its freshly painted shutters wellpolished brasses andgeneral cleanliness and gaiety of note instantly caught and pleasedthe eye of the passengerTwo doors from one corner on the left hand going east the linewas broken by the entry of a court and just at that point acertain sinister block of building thrust forward its gable on thestreet It was two stories high showed no window nothing but adoor on the lower story and a blind forehead of discoloured wall onthe upper and bore in every feature the marks of prolonged andsordid negligence The door which was equipped with neither bellnor knocker was blistered and distained Tramps slouched into therecess and struck matches onthe panels children kept shop upon the steps the schoolboy hadtried his knife on the mouldings and for close on a generation noone had appeared to drive away these random visitors or to repairtheir ravagesMr Enfield and the lawyer were on the other side of the bystreetbut when they came abreast of the entry the former lifted up hiscane and pointedDid you ever remark that door he asked and when his companionhad replied in the affirmative It is connected in my mind addedhe with a very odd storyIndeed said Mr Utterson with a slight change of voice andwhat was thatWell it was this way returned Mr Enfield I was coming homefrom some place at the end of the world about three oclock of ablack winter morning and my way lay through a part of town wherethere was literally nothing to be seen but lamps Street afterstreet and all the folks asleepstreet after street all lightedup as if for a procession and all as empty as a churchtill atlast I got into that state of mind when a man listens and listensand begins to long for the sight of a policeman All at once I sawtwo figures one a little man who was stumping along eastward at agood walk and the other a girl of maybe eight or ten who wasrunning as hard as she was able down a cross street Well sir thetwo ran into one another naturally enough at thecorner and then came the horrible part of the thing for the mantrampled calmly over the childs body and left her screaming onthe ground It sounds nothing to hear but it was hellish to seeIt wasnt like a man it was like some damned Juggernaut I gave aviewhalloa took to my heels collared my gentleman and broughthim back to where there was already quite a group about thescreaming child He was perfectly cool and made no resistance butgave me one look so ugly that it brought out the sweat on me likerunning The people who had turned out were the girls own familyand pretty soon the doctor for whom she had been sent put in hisappearance Well the child was not much the worse more frightenedaccording to the Sawbones and there you might have supposed wouldbe an end to it But there was one curious circumstance I had takena loathing to my gentleman at first sight So had the childsfamily which was only natural But the doctors case was whatstruck me He was the usual cutanddry apothecary of no particularage and colour with a strong Edinburgh accent and about asemotional as a bagpipe Well sir he was like the rest of us everytime he looked at my prisoner I saw that Sawbones turn sick andwhite with the desire to kill him I knew what was in his mind justas he knew what was in mine and killing being out of the questionwe did the next best We told the man we couldand would make such a scandal out of this as should make his namestink from one end of London to the other If he had any friends orany credit we undertook that he should lose them And all the timeas we were pitching it in red hot we were keeping the women off himas best we could for they were as wild as harpies I never saw acircle of such hateful faces and there was the man in the middlewith a kind of black sneering coolnessfrightened too I couldsee thatbut carrying it off sir really like Satan If youchoose to make capital out of this accident said he I amnaturally helpless No gentleman but wishes to avoid a scene sayshe Name your figure Well we screwed him up to a hundred poundsfor the childs family he would have clearly liked to stick outbut there was something about the lot of us that meant mischief andat last he struck The next thing was to get the money and wheredo you think he carried us but to that place with the doorwhipped out a key went in and presently came back with the matterof ten pounds in gold and a cheque for the balance on Couttssdrawn payable to bearer and signed with a name that I cant mentionthough its one of the points of my story but it was a name atleast very well known and often printed The figure was stiff butthe signature was good for more than that if it was only genuine Itook the liberty of pointing out to my gentleman that the wholebusiness looked apocryphal and that a man does not in real lifewalk into a cellar door at four in the morning and come out of itwith another mans cheque for close upon a hundred pounds But hewas quite easy and sneering Set your mind at rest says he Iwill stay with you till the banks open and cash the cheque myselfSo we all set off the doctor and the childs father and ourfriend and myself and passed the rest of the night in my chambersand next day when we had breakfasted went in a body to the bank Igave in the check myself and said I had every reason to believe itwas a forgery Not a bit of it The cheque was genuineTuttut said Mr UttersonI see you feel as I do said Mr Enfield Yes its a bad storyFor my man was a fellow that nobody could have to do with a reallydamnable man and the person that drew the cheque is the very pinkof the proprieties celebrated too and what makes it worse one ofyour fellows who do what they call good Blackmail I suppose anhonest man paying through the nose for some of the capers of hisyouth BlackMail House is what I call that place with the door inconsequence Though even that you know is far from explainingall he added and with the words fell into a vein of musingFrom this he was recalled by Mr Utterson asking rather suddenlyAnd you dont know if the drawer of the cheque lives thereA likely place isnt it returned Mr Enfield But I happen tohave noticed his address he lives in some square or otherAnd you never asked about theplace with the door said MrUttersonNo sir I had a delicacy was the reply I feel very stronglyabout putting questions it partakes too much of the style of theday of judgment You start a question and its like starting astone You sit quietly on the top of a hill and away the stonegoes starting others and presently some bland old bird the lastyou would have thought of is knocked on the head in his ownbackgarden and the family have to change their name No sir Imake it a rule of mine the more it looks like Queer Street theless I askA very good rule too said the lawyerBut I have studied the place for myself continued Mr EnfieldIt seems scarcely a house There is no other door and nobody goesin or out of that one but once in a great while the gentleman ofmy adventure There are three windows looking on the court on thefirst floor none below the windows are always shut but theyreclean And then there is a chimney which is generally smoking sosomebody must live there And yet its not so sure for thebuildings are so packed together about that court that its hard tosay where one ends and another beginsThe pair walked on again for a while in silence and thenEnfield said Mr Utterson thats a good rule of yoursYes I think it is returned EnfieldBut for all that continued the lawyer theres one point I wantto ask I want to ask the name of that man who walked over thechildWell said Mr Enfield I cant see what harm it would do Itwas a man of the name of HydeHm said Mr Utterson What sort of a man is he to seeHe is not easy to describe There is something wrong with hisappearance something displeasing something downright detestable Inever saw a man I so disliked and yet I scarce know why He must bedeformed somewhere he gives a strong feeling of deformity althoughI couldnt specify the point Hes an extraordinarylooking man andyet I really can name nothing out of the way No sir I can make nohand of it I cant describe him And its not want of memory for Ideclare I can see him this momentMr Utterson again walked some way in silence and obviously under aweight of considerationYou are sure he used a key he inquired at lastMy dear sir began Enfield surprised out of himselfYes I know said Utterson I know it must seem strange Thefact is if I do not ask you the name of the other party it isbecause I know it already You see Richard your tale has gonehome If you have been inexact in any point you had better correctitI think you might have warned me returned the other with atouch of sullenness But I have been pedantically exact as youcall it The fellow had a key and whats more he has it still Isaw him use it not a week agoMr Utterson sighed deeply but said never a word and the young manpresently resumed Here is another lesson to say nothing said heI am ashamed of my long tongue Let us make a bargain never torefer to this againWith all my heart said the lawyer I shake hands on thatRichard                        SEARCH FOR MR HYDETHAT evening Mr Utterson came home to his bachelor house in sombrespirits and sat down to dinner without relish It was his custom ofa Sunday when this meal was over to sit close by the fire avolume of some dry divinity on his readingdesk until the clock ofthe neighbouring church rang out the hour of twelve when he wouldgo soberly and gratefully to bed On this night however as soon asthe cloth was taken away he took up a candle and went into hisbusinessroom There he opened his safe took from the most privatepart of it a document endorsed on the envelope as Dr Jekylls Willand sat down with a clouded brow to study its contents The will washolograph for Mr Utterson though he took charge of it now that itwas made had refused to lend the least assistance in the making ofit it provided not only that in case of the decease of HenryJekyll MD DCL LLD FRS etc all his possessions wereto pass into the hands of his friend and benefactor Edward Hydebut that in case ofDr Jekylls disappearance or unexplained absence for any periodexceeding three calendar months the said Edward Hyde should stepinto the said Henry Jekylls shoes without further delay and freefrom any burthen or obligation beyond the payment of a few smallsums to the members of the doctors household This document hadlong been the lawyers eyesore It offended him both as a lawyer andas a lover of the sane and customary sides of life to whom thefanciful was the immodest And hitherto it was his ignorance of MrHyde that had swelled his indignation now by a sudden turn it washis knowledge It was already bad enough when the name was but aname of which he could learn no more It was worse when it began tobe clothed upon with detestable attributes and out of the shiftinginsubstantial mists that had so long baffled his eye there leapedup the sudden definite presentment of a fiendI thought it was madness he said as he replaced the obnoxiouspaper in the safe and now I begin to fear it is disgraceWith that he blew out his candle put on a greatcoat and setforth in the direction of Cavendish Square that citadel ofmedicine where his friend the great Dr Lanyon had his house andreceived his crowding patients If any one knows it will beLanyon he had thoughtThe solemn butler knew and welcomed himhe was subjected to no stage of delay but ushered direct from thedoor to the diningroom where Dr Lanyon sat alone over his wineThis was a hearty healthy dapper redfaced gentleman with ashock of hair prematurely white and a boisterous and decidedmanner At sight of Mr Utterson he sprang up from his chair andwelcomed him with both hands The geniality as was the way of theman was somewhat theatrical to the eye but it reposed on genuinefeeling For these two were old friends old mates both at schooland college both thorough respecters of themselves and of eachother and what does not always follow men who thoroughly enjoyedeach others companyAfter a little rambling talk the lawyer led up to the subjectwhich so disagreeably preoccupied his mindI suppose Lanyon said he you and I must be the two oldestfriends that Henry Jekyll hasI wish the friends were younger chuckled Dr Lanyon But Isuppose we are And what of that I see little of him nowIndeed said Utterson I thought you had a bond of commoninterestWe had was the reply But it is more than ten years since HenryJekyll became too fanciful for me He began to go wrong wrong inmind and though of course I continue to take an interest in him forold sakes sake as they sayI see and I have seen devilish little of the man Such unscientificbalderdash added the doctor flushing suddenly purple would haveestranged Damon and PythiasThis little spirit of temper was somewhat of a relief to MrUtterson They have only differed on some point of science hethought and being a man of no scientific passions except in thematter of conveyancing he even added It is nothing worse thanthat He gave his friend a few seconds to recover his composureand then approached the question he had come to put Did you evercome across a protege of hisone Hyde he askedHyde repeated Lanyon No Never heard of him Since my timeThat was the amount of information that the lawyer carried backwith him to the great dark bed on which he tossed to and frountil the small hours of the morning began to grow large It was anight of little ease to his toiling mind toiling in mere darknessand besieged by questionsSix oclock struck on the bells of the church that was soconveniently near to Mr Uttersons dwelling and still he wasdigging at the problem Hitherto it had touched him on theintellectual side alone but now his imagination also was engagedor rather enslaved and as he lay and tossed in the gross darknessof the night and the curtained room Mr Enfields tale went bybefore his mind in a scroll of lighted pictures He would be awareof the great field of lamps of a nocturnal city then of the figureof a man walking swiftly then of a child running from the doctorsand then these met and that human Juggernaut trod the child downand passed on regardless of her screams Or else he would see a roomin a rich house where his friend lay asleep dreaming and smilingat his dreams and then the door of that room would be opened thecurtains of the bed plucked apart the sleeper recalled and lothere would stand by his side a figure to whom power was given andeven at that dead hour he must rise and do its bidding The figurein these two phases haunted the lawyer all night and if at any timehe dozed over it was but to see it glide more stealthily throughsleeping houses or move the more swiftly and still the moreswiftly even to dizziness through wider labyrinths of lamplightedcity and at every streetcorner crush a child and leave herscreaming And still the figure had no face by which he might knowit even in his dreams it had no face or one that baffled him andmelted before his eyes and thus it was that there sprang up andgrew apace in the lawyers mind a singularly strong almost aninordinate curiosity to behold the features of the real Mr HydeIf he could but once set eyes on him he thought the mystery wouldlighten and perhaps roll altogether away as was the habit ofmysteriousthings when well examined He might see a reason for his friendsstrange preference or bondage call it which you please and evenfor the startling clause of the will At least it would be a faceworth seeing the face of a man who was without bowels of mercy aface which had but to show itself to raise up in the mind of theunimpressionable Enfield a spirit of enduring hatredFrom that time forward Mr Utterson began to haunt the door in thebystreet of shops In the morning before office hours at noon whenbusiness was plenty and time scarce at night under the face of thefogged city moon by all lights and at all hours of solitude orconcourse the lawyer was to be found on his chosen postIf he be Mr Hyde he had thought I shall be Mr SeekAnd at last his patience was rewarded It was a fine dry nightfrost in the air the streets as clean as a ballroom floor thelamps unshaken by any wind drawing a regular pattern of lightand shadow By ten oclock when the shops were closed thebystreet was very solitary and in spite of the low growl ofLondon from all round very silent Small sounds carried fardomestic sounds out of the houses were clearly audible on eitherside of the roadway and the rumour of the approach of anypassenger preceded him by a long time Mr Utterson had been someminutes at his post when he wasaware of an odd light footstep drawing near In the course of hisnightly patrols he had long grown accustomed to the quaint effectwith which the footfalls of a single person while he is still agreat way off suddenly spring out distinct from the vast hum andclatter of the city Yet his attention had never before been sosharply and decisively arrested and it was with a strongsuperstitious prevision of success that he withdrew into the entryof the courtThe steps drew swiftly nearer and swelled out suddenly louder asthey turned the end of the street The lawyer looking forth fromthe entry could soon see what manner of man he had to deal withHe was small and very plainly dressed and the look of him even atthat distance went somehow strongly against the watchersinclination But he made straight for the door crossing theroadway to save time and as he came he drew a key from his pocketlike one approaching homeMr Utterson stepped out and touched him on the shoulder as hepassed Mr Hyde I thinkMr Hyde shrank back with a hissing intake of the breath But hisfear was only momentary and though he did not look the lawyer inthe face he answered coolly enough That is my name What do youwantI see you are going in returned the lawyer I am an old friendof Dr JekyllsMr Utterson of Gaunt Streetyou must have heard my name and meeting youso conveniently I thought you might admit meYou will not find Dr Jekyll he is from home replied Mr Hydeblowing in the key And then suddenly but still without looking upHow did you know me he askedOn your side said Mr Utterson will you do me a favourWith pleasure replied the other What shall it beWill you let me see your face asked the lawyerMr Hyde appeared to hesitate and then as if upon some suddenreflection fronted about with an air of defiance and the pairstared at each other pretty fixedly for a few seconds Now I shallknow you again said Mr Utterson It may be usefulYes returned Mr Hyde it is as well we have met and apropos you should have my address And he gave a number of astreet in SohoGood God thought Mr Utterson can he too have been thinkingof the will But he kept his feelings to himself and only gruntedin acknowledgment of the addressAnd now said the other how did you know meBy description was the replyWhose descriptionWe have common friends said Mr UttersonCommon friends echoed Mr Hyde a little hoarsely Who aretheyJekyll for instance said the lawyerHe never told you cried Mr Hyde with a flush of anger I didnot think you would have liedCome said Mr Utterson that is not fitting languageThe other snarled aloud into a savage laugh and the next momentwith extraordinary quickness he had unlocked the door anddisappeared into the houseThe lawyer stood awhile when Mr Hyde had left him the picture ofdisquietude Then he began slowly to mount the street pausingevery step or two and putting his hand to his brow like a man inmental perplexity The problem he was thus debating as he walkedwas one of a class that is rarely solved Mr Hyde was pale anddwarfish he gave an impression of deformity without any nameablemalformation he had a displeasing smile he had borne himself tothe lawyer with a sort of murderous mixture of timidity andboldness and he spoke with a husky whispering and somewhat brokenvoice all these were points against him but not all of thesetogether could explain the hitherto unknown disgust loathing andfear with which Mr Utterson regarded him There must be something else said the perplexed gentleman There is somethingmore if I could find a name for it God bless me the man seemshardly human Something troglodytic shall we say or can it be theold story of Dr Fell or is it the mere radiance of a foul soulthat thus transpires through and transfigures its clay continentThe last I think for O my poor old Harry Jekyll if ever I readSatans signature upon a face it is on that of your new friendRound the corner from the bystreet there was a square of ancienthandsome houses now for the most part decayed from their highestate and let in flats and chambers to all sorts and conditions ofmen mapengravers architects shady lawyers and the agents ofobscure enterprises One house however second from the corner wasstill occupied entire and at the door of this which wore a greatair of wealth and comfort though it was now plunged in darknessexcept for the fanlight Mr Utterson stopped and knocked Awelldressed elderly servant opened the doorIs Dr Jekyll at home Poole asked the lawyerI will see Mr Utterson said Poole admitting the visitor ashe spoke into a large lowroofed comfortable hall paved withflags warmed after the fashion of a country house by a brightopen fire and furnished with costly cabinets of oak Will youwait here by thefire sir or shall I give you a light in the dining roomHere thank you said the lawyer and he drew near and leaned onthe tall fender This hall in which he was now left alone was apet fancy of his friend the doctors and Utterson himself was wontto speak of it as the pleasantest room in London But tonight therewas a shudder in his blood the face of Hyde sat heavy on hismemory he felt what was rare with him a nausea and distaste oflife and in the gloom of his spirits he seemed to read a menace inthe flickering of the firelight on the polished cabinets and theuneasy starting of the shadow on the roof He was ashamed of hisrelief when Poole presently returned to announce that Dr Jekyllwas gone outI saw Mr Hyde go in by the old dissectingroom door Poole hesaid Is that right when Dr Jekyll is from homeQuite right Mr Utterson sir replied the servant Mr Hydehas a keyYour master seems to repose a great deal of trust in that youngman Poole resumed the other musinglyYes sir he do indeed said Poole We have all orders to obeyhimI do not think I ever met Mr Hyde asked UttersonO dear no sir He never dines here replied the butler Indeedwe see very little ofhim on this side of the house he mostly comes and goes by thelaboratoryWell goodnight PooleGoodnight Mr Utterson And the lawyer set out homeward with avery heavy heart Poor Harry Jekyll he thought my mindmisgives me he is in deep waters He was wild when he was young along while ago to be sure but in the law of God there is nostatute of limitations Ay it must be that the ghost of some oldsin the cancer of some concealed disgrace punishment coming PEDECLAUDO years after memory has forgotten and selflove condoned thefault And the lawyer scared by the thought brooded a while onhis own past groping in all the corners of memory lest by chancesome JackintheBox of an old iniquity should leap to light thereHis past was fairly blameless few men could read the rolls of theirlife with less apprehension yet he was humbled to the dust by themany ill things he had done and raised up again into a sober andfearful gratitude by the many that he had come so near to doing yetavoided And then by a return on his former subject he conceived aspark of hope This Master Hyde if he were studied thought hemust have secrets of his own black secrets by the look of himsecrets compared to which poor Jekylls worst would be likesunshine Things cannot continue as they are It turns me cold tothink of this creature stealing like athief to Harrys bedside poor Harry what a wakening And thedanger of it for if this Hyde suspects the existence of the willhe may grow impatient to inherit Ay I must put my shoulder to thewheel if Jekyll will but let me he added if Jekyll will only letme For once more he saw before his minds eye as clear as atransparency the strange clauses of the will                      DR JEKYLL WAS QUITE AT EASEA FORTNIGHT later by excellent good fortune the doctor gave oneof his pleasant dinners to some five or six old cronies allintelligent reputable men and all judges of good wine and MrUtterson so contrived that he remained behind after the others haddeparted This was no new arrangement but a thing that hadbefallen many scores of times Where Utterson was liked he wasliked well Hosts loved to detain the dry lawyer when thelighthearted and the loosetongued had already their foot on thethreshold they liked to sit a while in his unobtrusive companypractising for solitude sobering their minds in the mans richsilence after the expense and strain of gaiety To this rule DrJekyll was no exception and as he now sat on the opposite side ofthe firea large wellmade smoothfaced man of fifty withsomething of a slyish cast perhaps but every mark of capacity andkindnessyou could see by his looks that he cherished for MrUtterson a sincere and warm affectionI have been wanting to speak to you Jekyll began the latterYou know that will of yoursA close observer might have gathered that the topic wasdistasteful but the doctor carried it off gaily My poorUtterson said he you are unfortunate in such a client I neversaw a man so distressed as you were by my will unless it were thathidebound pedant Lanyon at what he called my scientific heresiesOh I know hes a good fellowyou neednt frownan excellentfellow and I always mean to see more of him but a hideboundpedant for all that an ignorant blatant pedant I was never moredisappointed in any man than LanyonYou know I never approved of it pursued Utterson ruthlesslydisregarding the fresh topicMy will Yes certainly I know that said the doctor a triflesharply You have told me soWell I tell you so again continued the lawyer I have beenlearning something of young HydeThe large handsome face of Dr Jekyll grew pale to the very lipsand there came a blackness about his eyes I do not care to hearmore said he This is a matter I thought we had agreed to dropWhat I heard was abominable said UttersonIt can make no change You do not understand my position returned the doctor with a certain incoherencyof manner I am painfully situated Utterson my position is a verystrangea very strange one It is one of those affairs thatcannot be mended by talkingJekyll said Utterson you know me I am a man to be trustedMake a clean breast of this in confidence and I make no doubt Ican get you out of itMy good Utterson said the doctor this is very good of youthis is downright good of you and I cannot find words to thank youin I believe you fully I would trust you before any man alive aybefore myself if I could make the choice but indeed it isnt whatyou fancy it is not so bad as that and just to put your good heartat rest I will tell you one thing the moment I choose I can berid of Mr Hyde I give you my hand upon that and I thank you againand again and I will just add one little word Utterson that Imsure youll take in good part this is a private matter and I begof you to let it sleepUtterson reflected a little looking in the fireI have no doubt you are perfectly right he said at last gettingto his feetWell but since we have touched upon this business and for thelast time I hope continued the doctor there is one point Ishould like you to understand I have really a very great interestin poor Hyde I know you have seenhim he told me so and I fear he was rude But I do sincerelytake a great a very great interest in that young man and if I amtaken away Utterson I wish you to promise me that you will bearwith him and get his rights for him I think you would if you knewall and it would be a weight off my mind if you would promiseI cant pretend that I shall ever like him said the lawyerI dont ask that pleaded Jekyll laying his hand upon theothers arm I only ask for justice I only ask you to help himfor my sake when I am no longer hereUtterson heaved an irrepressible sigh Well said he Ipromise                      THE CAREW MURDER CASENEARLY a year later in the month of October  London wasstartled by a crime of singular ferocity and rendered all the morenotable by the high position of the victim The details were few andstartling A maid servant living alone in a house not far from theriver had gone upstairs to bed about eleven Although a fog rolledover the city in the small hours the early part of the night wascloudless and the lane which the maids window overlooked wasbrilliantly lit by the full moon It seems she was romanticallygiven for she sat down upon her box which stood immediately underthe window and fell into a dream of musing Never she used to saywith streaming tears when she narrated that experience never hadshe felt more at peace with all men or thought more kindly of theworld And as she so sat she became aware of an aged and beautifulgentleman with white hair drawing near along the lane andadvancing to meet him another and very small gentleman to whom atfirst shepaid less attention When they had come within speech which wasjust under the maids eyes the older man bowed and accosted theother with a very pretty manner of politeness It did not seem asif the subject of his address were of great importance indeedfrom his pointing it sometimes appeared as if he were onlyinquiring his way but the moon shone on his face as he spoke andthe girl was pleased to watch it it seemed to breathe such aninnocent and oldworld kindness of disposition yet with somethinghigh too as of a wellfounded selfcontent Presently her eyewandered to the other and she was surprised to recognise in him acertain Mr Hyde who had once visited her master and for whom shehad conceived a dislike He had in his hand a heavy cane with whichhe was trifling but he answered never a word and seemed to listenwith an illcontained impatience And then all of a sudden he brokeout in a great flame of anger stamping with his foot brandishingthe cane and carrying on as the maid described it like a madmanThe old gentleman took a step back with the air of one very muchsurprised and a trifle hurt and at that Mr Hyde broke out of allbounds and clubbed him to the earth And next moment with apelikefury he was trampling his victim under foot and hailing down astorm of blows under which the bones were audibly shattered and thebody jumped upon the roadway At the horror of these sights andsounds the maid faintedIt was two oclock when she came to herself and called for thepolice The murderer was gone long ago but there lay his victim inthe middle of the lane incredibly mangled The stick with which thedeed had been done although it was of some rare and very tough andheavy wood had broken in the middle under the stress of thisinsensate cruelty and one splintered half had rolled in theneighbouring gutterthe other without doubt had been carriedaway by the murderer A purse and a gold watch were found upon thevictim but no cards or papers except a sealed and stampedenvelope which he had been probably carrying to the post and whichbore the name and address of Mr UttersonThis was brought to the lawyer the next morning before he was outof bed and he had no sooner seen it and been told thecircumstances than he shot out a solemn lip I shall say nothingtill I have seen the body said he this may be very serious Havethe kindness to wait while I dress And with the same gravecountenance he hurried through his breakfast and drove to the policestation whither the body had been carried As soon as he came intothe cell he noddedYes said he I recognise him I am sorry to say that this isSir Danvers CarewGood God sir exclaimed the officer is it possible And thenext moment his eyelighted up with professional ambition This will make a deal ofnoise he said And perhaps you can help us to the man And hebriefly narrated what the maid had seen and showed the brokenstickMr Utterson had already quailed at the name of Hyde but when thestick was laid before him he could doubt no longer broken andbattered as it was he recognised it for one that he had himselfpresented many years before to Henry JekyllIs this Mr Hyde a person of small stature he inquiredParticularly small and particularly wickedlooking is what themaid calls him said the officerMr Utterson reflected and then raising his head If you willcome with me in my cab he said I think I can take you to hishouseIt was by this time about nine in the morning and the first fog ofthe season A great chocolatecoloured pall lowered over heaven butthe wind was continually charging and routing these embattledvapours so that as the cab crawled from street to street MrUtterson beheld a marvellous number of degrees and hues of twilightfor here it would be dark like the backend of evening and therewould be a glow of a rich lurid brown like the light of somestrange conflagration and here for a moment the fog would bequite broken up and a haggard shaftof daylight would glance in between the swirling wreaths Thedismal quarter of Soho seen under these changing glimpses with itsmuddy ways and slatternly passengers and its lamps which hadnever been extinguished or had been kindled afresh to combat thismournful reinvasion of darkness seemed in the lawyers eyes likea district of some city in a nightmare The thoughts of his mindbesides were of the gloomiest dye and when he glanced at thecompanion of his drive he was conscious of some touch of thatterror of the law and the laws officers which may at times assailthe most honestAs the cab drew up before the address indicated the fog lifted alittle and showed him a dingy street a gin palace a low Frencheatinghouse a shop for the retail of penny numbers and twopennysalads many ragged children huddled in the doorways and manywomen of different nationalities passing out key in hand to have amorning glass and the next moment the fog settled down again uponthat part as brown as umber and cut him off from his blackguardlysurroundings This was the home of Henry Jekylls favourite of aman who was heir to a quarter of a million sterlingAn ivoryfaced and silveryhaired old woman opened the door Shehad an evil face smoothed by hypocrisy but her manners wereexcellent Yes she said this was Mr Hydes but he was not athome he had been in that night very latebut had gone away again in less than an hour there was nothingstrange in that his habits were very irregular and he was oftenabsent for instance it was nearly two months since she had seenhim till yesterdayVery well then we wish to see his rooms said the lawyer andwhen the woman began to declare it was impossible I had bettertell you who this person is he added This is Inspector Newcomenof Scotland YardA flash of odious joy appeared upon the womans face Ah saidshe he is in trouble What has he doneMr Utterson and the inspector exchanged glances He dont seem avery popular character observed the latter And now my goodwoman just let me and this gentleman have a look about usIn the whole extent of the house which but for the old womanremained otherwise empty Mr Hyde had only used a couple of roomsbut these were furnished with luxury and good taste A closet wasfilled with wine the plate was of silver the napery elegant agood picture hung upon the walls a gift as Utterson supposed fromHenry Jekyll who was much of a connoisseur and the carpets were ofmany plies and agreeable in colour At this moment however therooms bore every mark of having been recently and hurriedlyransacked clothes lay about the floor with their pockets insideoutlockfast drawers stood open and on the hearth there lay a pile ofgrey ashes as though many papers had been burned From theseembers the inspector disinterred the buttend of a greenchequebook which had resisted the action of the fire the otherhalf of the stick was found behind the door and as this clinchedhis suspicions the officer declared himself delighted A visit tothe bank where several thousand pounds were found to be lying tothe murderers credit completed his gratificationYou may depend upon it sir he told Mr Utterson I have him inmy hand He must have lost his head or he never would have left thestick or above all burned the chequebook Why moneys life tothe man We have nothing to do but wait for him at the bank and getout the handbillsThis last however was not so easy of accomplishment for Mr Hydehad numbered few familiarseven the master of the servantmaidhad only seen him twice his family could nowhere be traced he hadnever been photographed and the few who could describe him differedwidely as common observers will Only on one point were theyagreed and that was the haunting sense of unexpressed deformitywith which the fugitive impressed his beholders                     INCIDENT OF THE LETTERIT was late in the afternoon when Mr Utterson found his way toDr Jekylls door where he was at once admitted by Poole andcarried down by the kitchen offices and across a yard which hadonce been a garden to the building which was indifferently knownas the laboratory or the dissectingrooms The doctor had boughtthe house from the heirs of a celebrated surgeon and his owntastes being rather chemical than anatomical had changed thedestination of the block at the bottom of the garden It was thefirst time that the lawyer had been received in that part of hisfriends quarters and he eyed the dingy windowless structure withcuriosity and gazed round with a distasteful sense of strangenessas he crossed the theatre once crowded with eager students and nowlying gaunt and silent the tables laden with chemical apparatusthe floor strewn with crates and littered with packing straw andthe light falling dimly through the foggy cupola At the furtherend a flight of stairs mounted to a door covered with red baizeand through this Mr Utterson was at last received into thedoctors cabinet It was a large room fitted round with glasspresses furnished among other things with a chevalglass and abusiness table and looking out upon the court by three dustywindows barred with iron A fire burned in the grate a lamp wasset lighted on the chimney shelf for even in the houses the fogbegan to lie thickly and there close up to the warmth sat DrJekyll looking deadly sick He did not rise to meet his visitorbut held out a cold hand and bade him welcome in a changed voiceAnd now said Mr Utterson as soon as Poole had left them youhave heard the newsThe doctor shuddered They were crying it in the square he saidI heard them in my diningroomOne word said the lawyer Carew was my client but so are youand I want to know what I am doing You have not been mad enough tohide this fellowUtterson I swear to God cried the doctor I swear to God Iwill never set eyes on him again I bind my honour to you that I amdone with him in this world It is all at an end And indeed he doesnot want my help you do not know him as I do he is safe he isquite safe mark my words he will never more be heard ofThe lawyer listened gloomily he did not like his friends feverishmanner You seem prettysure of him said he and for your sake I hope you may be rightIf it came to a trial your name might appearI am quite sure of him replied Jekyll I have grounds forcertainty that I cannot share with any one But there is one thingon which you may advise me I haveI have received a letter andI am at a loss whether I should show it to the police I should liketo leave it in your hands Utterson you would judge wisely I amsure I have so great a trust in youYou fear I suppose that it might lead to his detection askedthe lawyerNo said the other I cannot say that I care what becomes ofHyde I am quite done with him I was thinking of my own characterwhich this hateful business has rather exposedUtterson ruminated a while he was surprised at his friendsselfishness and yet relieved by it Well said he at last letme see the letterThe letter was written in an odd upright hand and signed EdwardHyde and it signified briefly enough that the writersbenefactor Dr Jekyll whom he had long so unworthily repaid for athousand generosities need labour under no alarm for his safety ashe had means of escape on which he placed a sure dependence Thelawyer liked this letter well enough it put a better colour on theintimacy than he had looked for and he blamed himself for some ofhis past suspicionsHave you the envelope he askedI burned it replied Jekyll before I thought what I was aboutBut it bore no postmark The note was handed inShall I keep this and sleep upon it asked UttersonI wish you to judge for me entirely was the reply I have lostconfidence in myselfWell I shall consider returned the lawyer And now one wordmore it was Hyde who dictated the terms in your will about thatdisappearanceThe doctor seemed seized with a qualm of faintness he shut hismouth tight and noddedI knew it said Utterson He meant to murder you You have had afine escapeI have had what is far more to the purpose returned the doctorsolemnly I have had a lessonO God Utterson what a lesson Ihave had And he covered his face for a moment with his handsOn his way out the lawyer stopped and had a word or two withPoole By the by said he there was a letter handed in todaywhat was the messenger like But Poole was positive nothing hadcome except by post and only circulars by that he addedThis news sent off the visitor with his fears renewed Plainly theletter had come by the laboratory door possibly indeed it hadbeenwritten in the cabinet and if that were so it must be differentlyjudged and handled with the more caution The newsboys as he wentwere crying themselves hoarse along the footways Special editionShocking murder of an M P That was the funeral oration of onefriend and client and he could not help a certain apprehension lestthe good name of another should be sucked down in the eddy of thescandal It was at least a ticklish decision that he had to makeand selfreliant as he was by habit he began to cherish a longingfor advice It was not to be had directly but perhaps he thoughtit might be fished forPresently after he sat on one side of his own hearth with MrGuest his head clerk upon the other and midway between at anicely calculated distance from the fire a bottle of a particularold wine that had long dwelt unsunned in the foundations of hishouse The fog still slept on the wing above the drowned city wherethe lamps glimmered like carbuncles and through the muffle andsmother of these fallen clouds the procession of the towns lifewas still rolling in through the great arteries with a sound as of amighty wind But the room was gay with firelight In the bottle theacids were long ago resolved the imperial dye had softened withtime As the colour grows richer in stained windows and the glow ofhot autumn afternoons on hillside vineyards was ready to be set freeand to disperse the fogs of London Insensibly the lawyer meltedThere was no man from whom he kept fewer secrets than Mr Guestand he was not always sure that he kept as many as he meant Guesthad often been on business to the doctors he knew Poole he couldscarce have failed to hear of Mr Hydes familiarity about thehouse he might draw conclusions was it not as well then that heshould see a letter which put that mystery to rights and above allsince Guest being a great student and critic of handwriting wouldconsider the step natural and obliging The clerk besides was aman of counsel he would scarce read so strange a document withoutdropping a remark and by that remark Mr Utterson might shape hisfuture courseThis is a sad business about Sir Danvers he saidYes sir indeed It has elicited a great deal of public feelingreturned Guest The man of course was madI should like to hear your views on that replied Utterson Ihave a document here in his handwriting it is between ourselvesfor I scarce know what to do about it it is an ugly business atthe best But there it is quite in your way a murderersautographGuests eyes brightened and he sat down at once and studied itwith passion No sir he said not mad but it is an odd handAnd by all accounts a very odd writer added the lawyerJust then the servant entered with a noteIs that from Dr Jekyll sir inquired the clerk I thought Iknew the writing Anything private Mr UttersonOnly an invitation to dinner Why Do you want to see itOne moment I thank you sir and the clerk laid the two sheetsof paper alongside and sedulously compared their contents Thankyou sir he said at last returning both its a veryinteresting autographThere was a pause during which Mr Utterson struggled withhimself Why did you compare them Guest he inquired suddenlyWell sir returned the clerk theres a rather singularresemblance the two hands are in many points identical onlydifferently slopedRather quaint said UttersonIt is as you say rather quaint returned GuestI wouldnt speak of this note you know said the masterNo sir said the clerk I understandBut no sooner was Mr Utterson alone that night than he locked thenote into his safe where it reposed from that time forwardWhat he thought Henry Jekyll forge for a murderer And hisblood ran cold in his veins                     REMARKABLE INCIDENT OF DR LANYONTIME ran on thousands of pounds were offered in reward for thedeath of Sir Danvers was resented as a public injury but Mr Hydehad disappeared out of the ken of the police as though he had neverexisted Much of his past was unearthed indeed and alldisreputable tales came out of the mans cruelty at once socallous and violent of his vile life of his strange associatesof the hatred that seemed to have surrounded his career but of hispresent whereabouts not a whisper From the time he had left thehouse in Soho on the morning of the murder he was simply blottedout and gradually as time drew on Mr Utterson began to recoverfrom the hotness of his alarm and to grow more at quiet withhimself The death of Sir Danvers was to his way of thinking morethan paid for by the disappearance of Mr Hyde Now that that evilinfluence had been withdrawn a new life began for Dr Jekyll Hecame out of his seclusion renewed relations with his friendsbecame once more their familiar guestand entertainer and whilst he had always been known forcharities he was now no less distinguished for religion He wasbusy he was much in the open air he did good his face seemed toopen and brighten as if with an inward consciousness of serviceand for more than two months the doctor was at peaceOn the th of January Utterson had dined at the doctors with asmall party Lanyon had been there and the face of the host hadlooked from one to the other as in the old days when the trio wereinseparable friends On the th and again on the th the doorwas shut against the lawyer The doctor was confined to thehouse Poole said and saw no one On the th he tried againand was again refused and having now been used for the last twomonths to see his friend almost daily he found this return ofsolitude to weigh upon his spirits The fifth night he had in Guestto dine with him and the sixth he betook himself to Dr LanyonsThere at least he was not denied admittance but when he came inhe was shocked at the change which had taken place in the doctorsappearance He had his deathwarrant written legibly upon his faceThe rosy man had grown pale his flesh had fallen away he wasvisibly balder and older and yet it was not so much these tokensof a swift physical decay that arrested the lawyers notice as alook in the eye and quality of manner that seemed to testify tosome deepseated terror of the mind It was unlikely that thedoctor should fear death and yet that was what Utterson wastempted to suspect Yes he thought he is a doctor he mustknow his own state and that his days are counted and the knowledgeis more than he can bear And yet when Utterson remarked on hisilllooks it was with an air of greatness that Lanyon declaredhimself a doomed manI have had a shock he said and I shall never recover It is aquestion of weeks Well life has been pleasant I liked it yessir I used to like it I sometimes think if we knew all we shouldbe more glad to get awayJekyll is ill too observed Utterson Have you seen himBut Lanyons face changed and he held up a trembling hand I wishto see or hear no more of Dr Jekyll he said in a loud unsteadyvoice I am quite done with that person and I beg that you willspare me any allusion to one whom I regard as deadTuttut said Mr Utterson and then after a considerable pauseCant I do anything he inquired We are three very old friendsLanyon we shall not live to make othersNothing can be done returned Lanyon ask himselfHe will not see me said the lawyerI am not surprised at that was the reply Some day Uttersonafter I am dead you mayperhaps come to learn the right and wrong of this I cannot tellyou And in the meantime if you can sit and talk with me of otherthings for Gods sake stay and do so but if you cannot keep clearof this accursed topic then in Gods name go for I cannot bearitAs soon as he got home Utterson sat down and wrote to Jekyllcomplaining of his exclusion from the house and asking the causeof this unhappy break with Lanyon and the next day brought him along answer often very pathetically worded and sometimes darklymysterious in drift The quarrel with Lanyon was incurable I donot blame our old friend Jekyll wrote but I share his viewthat we must never meet I mean from henceforth to lead a life ofextreme seclusion you must not be surprised nor must you doubtmy friendship if my door is often shut even to you You mustsuffer me to go my own dark way I have brought on myself apunishment and a danger that I cannot name If I am the chief ofsinners I am the chief of sufferers also I could not think thatthis earth contained a place for sufferings and terrors sounmanning and you can do but one thing Utterson to lightenthis destiny and that is to respect my silence Utterson wasamazed the dark influence of Hyde had been withdrawn the doctorhad returned to his old tasks and amities a week ago theprospect had smiled with every promise of a cheerful and anhonoured ageand now in a moment friendship and peace of mind and the wholetenor of his life were wrecked So great and unprepared a changepointed to madness but in view of Lanyons manner and wordsthere must lie for it some deeper groundA week afterwards Dr Lanyon took to his bed and in somethingless than a fortnight he was dead The night after the funeralat which he had been sadly affected Utterson locked the door ofhis business room and sitting there by the light of a melancholycandle drew out and set before him an envelope addressed by thehand and sealed with the seal of his dead friend PRIVATE forthe hands of G J Utterson ALONE and in case of his predeceaseto be destroyed unread so it was emphatically superscribed andthe lawyer dreaded to behold the contents I have buried onefriend today he thought what if this should cost meanother And then he condemned the fear as a disloyalty andbroke the seal Within there was another enclosure likewisesealed and marked upon the cover as not to be opened till thedeath or disappearance of Dr Henry Jekyll Utterson could nottrust his eyes Yes it was disappearance here again as in themad will which he had long ago restored to its author here againwere the idea of a disappearance and the name of Henry Jekyllbracketed But in the will that idea had sprung from thesinister suggestion ofthe man Hyde it was set there with a purpose all too plain andhorrible Written by the hand of Lanyon what should it mean Agreat curiosity came on the trustee to disregard the prohibitionand dive at once to the bottom of these mysteries butprofessional honour and faith to his dead friend were stringentobligations and the packet slept in the inmost corner of hisprivate safeIt is one thing to mortify curiosity another to conquer it andit may be doubted if from that day forth Utterson desired thesociety of his surviving friend with the same eagerness Hethought of him kindly but his thoughts were disquieted andfearful He went to call indeed but he was perhaps relieved tobe denied admittance perhaps in his heart he preferred tospeak with Poole upon the doorstep and surrounded by the air andsounds of the open city rather than to be admitted into thathouse of voluntary bondage and to sit and speak with itsinscrutable recluse Poole had indeed no very pleasant news tocommunicate The doctor it appeared now more than ever confinedhimself to the cabinet over the laboratory where he wouldsometimes even sleep he was out of spirits he had grown verysilent he did not read it seemed as if he had something on hismind Utterson became so used to the unvarying character of thesereports that he fell off little by little in the frequency ofhis visits                      INCIDENT AT THE WINDOWIT chanced on Sunday when Mr Utterson was on his usual walkwith Mr Enfield that their way lay once again through thebystreet and that when they came in front of the door bothstopped to gaze on itWell said Enfield that storys at an end at least We shallnever see more of Mr HydeI hope not said Utterson Did I ever tell you that I once sawhim and shared your feeling of repulsionIt was impossible to do the one without the other returnedEnfield And by the way what an ass you must have thought menot to know that this was a back way to Dr Jekylls It waspartly your own fault that I found it out even when I didSo you found it out did you said Utterson But if that beso we may step into the court and take a look at the windows Totell you the truth I am uneasy about poor Jekyll and evenoutside I feel as if the presence of a friend might do himgoodThe court was very cool and a little damp and full of prematuretwilight although the sky high up overhead was still brightwith sunset The middle one of the three windows was halfwayopen and sitting close beside it taking the air with aninfinite sadness of mien like some disconsolate prisonerUtterson saw Dr JekyllWhat Jekyll he cried I trust you are betterI am very low Utterson replied the doctor drearily verylow It will not last long thank GodYou stay too much indoors said the lawyer You should be outwhipping up the circulation like Mr Enfield and me This is mycousinMr EnfieldDr Jekyll Come now get your hat andtake a quick turn with usYou are very good sighed the other I should like to verymuch but no no no it is quite impossible I dare not Butindeed Utterson I am very glad to see you this is really agreat pleasure I would ask you and Mr Enfield up but the placeis really not fitWhy then said the lawyer goodnaturedly the best thing wecan do is to stay down here and speak with you from where weareThat is just what I was about to venture to propose returnedthe doctor with a smile But the words were hardly utteredbefore the smile was struck out of his face and succeededby an expression of such abject terror and despair as froze thevery blood of the two gentlemen below They saw it but for aglimpse for the window was instantly thrust down but thatglimpse had been sufficient and they turned and left the courtwithout a word In silence too they traversed the bystreetand it was not until they had come into a neighbouringthoroughfare where even upon a Sunday there were still somestirrings of life that Mr Utterson at last turned and looked athis companion They were both pale and there was an answeringhorror in their eyesGod forgive us God forgive us said Mr UttersonBut Mr Enfield only nodded his head very seriously and walked ononce more in silence                             THE LAST NIGHTMR UTTERSON was sitting by his fireside one evening afterdinner when he was surprised to receive a visit from PooleBless me Poole what brings you here he cried and thentaking a second look at him What ails you he added is thedoctor illMr Utterson said the man there is something wrongTake a seat and here is a glass of wine for you said thelawyer Now take your time and tell me plainly what you wantYou know the doctors ways sir replied Poole and how heshuts himself up Well hes shut up again in the cabinet and Idont like it sirI wish I may die if I like it Mr Uttersonsir Im afraidNow my good man said the lawyer be explicit What are youafraid ofIve been afraid for about a week returned Poole doggedlydisregarding the question and I can bear it no moreThe mans appearance amply bore out hiswords his manner was altered for the worse and except for themoment when he had first announced his terror he had not oncelooked the lawyer in the face Even now he sat with the glass ofwine untasted on his knee and his eyes directed to a corner ofthe floor I can bear it no more he repeatedCome said the lawyer I see you have some good reason PooleI see there is something seriously amiss Try to tell me what itisI think theres been foul play said Poole hoarselyFoul play cried the lawyer a good deal frightened and ratherinclined to be irritated in consequence What foul play Whatdoes the man meanI darent say sir was the answer but will you come alongwith me and see for yourselfMr Uttersons only answer was to rise and get his hat andgreatcoat but he observed with wonder the greatness of therelief that appeared upon the butlers face and perhaps with noless that the wine was still untasted when he set it down tofollowIt was a wild cold seasonable night of March with a pale moonlying on her back as though the wind had tilted her and a flyingwrack of the most diaphanous and lawny texture The wind madetalking difficult and flecked the blood into the face It seemedto have swept thestreets unusually bare of passengers besides for Mr Uttersonthought he had never seen that part of London so deserted Hecould have wished it otherwise never in his life had he beenconscious of so sharp a wish to see and touch hisfellowcreatures for struggle as he might there was borne inupon his mind a crushing anticipation of calamity The squarewhen they got there was all full of wind and dust and the thintrees in the garden were lashing themselves along the railingPoole who had kept all the way a pace or two ahead now pulledup in the middle of the pavement and in spite of the bitingweather took off his hat and mopped his brow with a redpockethandkerchief But for all the hurry of his cowing thesewere not the dews of exertion that he wiped away but themoisture of some strangling anguish for his face was white andhis voice when he spoke harsh and brokenWell sir he said here we are and God grant there benothing wrongAmen Poole said the lawyerThereupon the servant knocked in a very guarded manner the doorwas opened on the chain and a voice asked from within Is thatyou PooleIts all right said Poole Open the door The hall whenthey entered it was brightly lighted up the fire was builthigh and about the hearth the whole of the servants men andwomen stood huddled together like a flock of sheep At the sightof Mr Utterson the housemaid broke into hysterical whimperingand the cook crying out Bless God its Mr Utterson ranforward as if to take him in her armsWhat what Are you all here said the lawyer peevishly Veryirregular very unseemly your master would be far from pleasedTheyre all afraid said PooleBlank silence followed no one protesting only the maid liftedup her voice and now wept loudlyHold your tongue Poole said to her with a ferocity of accentthat testified to his own jangled nerves and indeed when thegirl had so suddenly raised the note of her lamentation they hadall started and turned toward the inner door with faces ofdreadful expectation And now continued the butler addressingthe knifeboy reach me a candle and well get this throughhands at once And then he begged Mr Utterson to follow himand led the way to the backgardenNow sir said he you come as gently as you can I want youto hear and I dont want you to be heard And see here sir ifby any chance he was to ask you in dont goMr Uttersons nerves at this unlookedfor termination gave ajerk that nearly threw him from his balance but he recollectedhis courageand followed the butler into the laboratory building and throughthe surgical theatre with its lumber of crates and bottles tothe foot of the stair Here Poole motioned him to stand on oneside and listen while he himself setting down the candle andmaking a great and obvious call on his resolution mounted thesteps and knocked with a somewhat uncertain hand on the red baizeof the cabinet doorMr Utterson sir asking to see you he called and even as hedid so once more violently signed to the lawyer to give earA voice answered from within Tell him I cannot see any one itsaid complaininglyThank you sir said Poole with a note of something liketriumph in his voice and taking up his candle he led MrUtterson back across the yard and into the great kitchen wherethe fire was out and the beetles were leaping on the floorSir he said looking Mr Utterson in the eyes was that mymasters voiceIt seems much changed replied the lawyer very pale butgiving look for lookChanged Well yes I think so said the butler Have I beentwenty years in this mans house to be deceived about his voiceNo sir masters made away with he was made away with eightdays ago when we heard him cry out upon the name of God andwhos in there instead of him and why it stays there is a thingthat cries to Heaven Mr UttersonThis is a very strange tale Poole this is rather a wild talemy man said Mr Utterson biting his finger Suppose it wereas you suppose supposing Dr Jekyll to have beenwellmurdered what could induce the murderer to stay That wont holdwater it doesnt commend itself to reasonWell Mr Utterson you are a hard man to satisfy but Ill doit yet said Poole All this last week you must know him orit or whatever it is that lives in that cabinet has been cryingnight and day for some sort of medicine and cannot get it to hismind It was sometimes his waythe masters that istowrite his orders on a sheet of paper and throw it on the stairWeve had nothing else this week back nothing but papers and aclosed door and the very meals left there to be smuggled in whennobody was looking Well sir every day ay and twice andthrice in the same day there have been orders and complaintsand I have been sent flying to all the wholesale chemists intown Every time I brought the stuff back there would be anotherpaper telling me to return it because it was not pure andanother order to a different firm This drug is wanted bitterbad sir whatever forHave you any of these papers asked Mr UttersonPoole felt in his pocket and handed out a crumpled note whichthe lawyer bending nearerto the candle carefully examined Its contents ran thus DrJekyll presents his compliments to Messrs Maw He assures themthat their last sample is impure and quite useless for hispresent purpose In the year  Dr J purchased a somewhatlarge quantity from Messrs M He now begs them to search withthe most sedulous care and should any of the same quality beleft to forward it to him at once Expense is no considerationThe importance of this to Dr J can hardly be exaggerated Sofar the letter had run composedly enough but here with a suddensplutter of the pen the writers emotion had broken loose ForGods sake he had added find me some of the oldThis is a strange note said Mr Utterson and then sharplyHow do you come to have it openThe man at Maws was main angry sir and he threw it back to melike so much dirt returned PooleThis is unquestionably the doctors hand do you know resumedthe lawyerI thought it looked like it said the servant rather sulkilyand then with another voice But what matters handofwritehe said Ive seen himSeen him repeated Mr Utterson WellThats it said Poole It was this way I came suddenly intothe theatre from thegarden It seems he had slipped out to look for this drug orwhatever it is for the cabinet door was open and there he wasat the far end of the room digging among the crates He looked upwhen I came in gave a kind of cry and whipped upstairs intothe cabinet It was but for one minute that I saw him but thehair stood upon my head like quills Sir if that was my masterwhy had he a mask upon his face If it was my master why did hecry out like a rat and run from me I have served him longenough And then The man paused and passed his hand over hisfaceThese are all very strange circumstances said Mr Uttersonbut I think I begin to see daylight Your master Poole isplainly seized with one of those maladies that both torture anddeform the sufferer hence for aught I know the alteration ofhis voice hence the mask and the avoidance of his friends hencehis eagerness to find this drug by means of which the poor soulretains some hope of ultimate recoveryGod grant that he benot deceived There is my explanation it is sad enough Pooleay and appalling to consider but it is plain and natural hangswell together and delivers us from all exorbitant alarmsSir said the butler turning to a sort of mottled pallorthat thing was not my master and theres the truth My masterhere he looked round him and began to whisperisa tall fine build of a man and this was more of a dwarfUtterson attempted to protest O sir cried Poole do youthink I do not know my master after twenty years Do you think Ido not know where his head comes to in the cabinet door where Isaw him every morning of my life No Sir that thing in the maskwas never Dr JekyllGod knows what it was but it was neverDr Jekyll and it is the belief of my heart that there wasmurder donePoole replied the lawyer if you say that it will become myduty to make certain Much as I desire to spare your mastersfeelings much as I am puzzled by this note which seems to provehim to be still alive I shall consider it my duty to break inthat doorAh Mr Utterson thats talking cried the butlerAnd now comes the second question resumed Utterson Who isgoing to do itWhy you and me was the undaunted replyThats very well said returned the lawyer and whatever comesof it I shall make it my business to see you are no loserThere is an axe in the theatre continued Poole and you mighttake the kitchen poker for yourselfThe lawyer took that rude but weighty instrument into his handand balanced it Do you know Poole he said looking up thatyou and I are about to place ourselves in a position of someperilYou may say so sir indeed returned the butlerIt is well then that we should be frank said the other Weboth think more than we have said let us make a clean breastThis masked figure that you saw did you recognise itWell sir it went so quick and the creature was so doubled upthat I could hardly swear to that was the answer But if youmean was it Mr Hydewhy yes I think it was You see itwas much of the same bigness and it had the same quick lightway with it and then who else could have got in by thelaboratory door You have not forgot sir that at the time of themurder he had still the key with him But thats not all I dontknow Mr Utterson if ever you met this Mr HydeYes said the lawyer I once spoke with himThen you must know as well as the rest of us that there wassomething queer about that gentlemansomething that gave a mana turnI dont know rightly how to say it sir beyond thisthat you felt it in your marrow kind of cold and thinI own I felt something of what you describe said Mr UttersonQuite so sir returned Poole Well whenthat masked thing like a monkey jumped from among the chemicalsand whipped into the cabinet it went down my spine like ice OhI know its not evidence Mr Utterson Im booklearned enoughfor that but a man has his feelings and I give you myBibleword it was Mr HydeAy ay said the lawyer My fears incline to the same pointEvil I fear foundedevil was sure to comeof thatconnection Ay truly I believe you I believe poor Harry iskilled and I believe his murderer for what purpose God alonecan tell is still lurking in his victims room Well let ourname be vengeance Call BradshawThe footman came at the summons very white and nervousPull yourself together Bradshaw said the lawyer Thissuspense I know is telling upon all of you but it is now ourintention to make an end of it Poole here and I are going toforce our way into the cabinet If all is well my shoulders arebroad enough to bear the blame Meanwhile lest anything shouldreally be amiss or any malefactor seek to escape by the backyou and the boy must go round the corner with a pair of goodsticks and take your post at the laboratory door We give you tenminutes to get to your stationsAs Bradshaw left the lawyer looked at his watch And nowPoole let us get to ourshe said and taking the poker under his arm led the way into theyard The scud had banked over the moon and it was now quitedark The wind which only broke in puffs and draughts into thatdeep well of building tossed the light of the candle to and froabout their steps until they came into the shelter of thetheatre where they sat down silently to wait London hummedsolemnly all around but nearer at hand the stillness was onlybroken by the sounds of a footfall moving to and fro along thecabinet floorSo it will walk all day sir whispered Poole ay and thebetter part of the night Only when a new sample comes from thechemist theres a bit of a break Ah its an ill consciencethats such an enemy to rest Ah sir theres blood foully shedin every step of it But hark again a little closerput yourheart in your ears Mr Utterson and tell me is that thedoctors footThe steps fell lightly and oddly with a certain swing for allthey went so slowly it was different indeed from the heavycreaking tread of Henry Jekyll Utterson sighed Is there neveranything else he askedPoole nodded Once he said Once I heard it weepingWeeping how that said the lawyer conscious of a sudden chillof horrorWeeping like a woman or a lost soul saidthe butler I came away with that upon my heart that I couldhave wept tooBut now the ten minutes drew to an end Poole disinterred the axefrom under a stack of packing straw the candle was set upon thenearest table to light them to the attack and they drew nearwith bated breath to where that patient foot was still going upand down up and down in the quiet of the nightJekyll cried Utterson with a loud voice I demand to seeyou He paused a moment but there came no reply I give youfair warning our suspicions are aroused and I must and shallsee you he resumed if not by fair means then by foul if notof your consent then by brute forceUtterson said the voice for Gods sake have mercyAh thats not Jekylls voiceits Hydes cried UttersonDown with the door PoolePoole swung the axe over his shoulder the blow shook thebuilding and the red baize door leaped against the lock andhinges A dismal screech as of mere animal terror rang from thecabinet Up went the axe again and again the panels crashed andthe frame bounded four times the blow fell but the wood wastough and the fittings were of excellent workmanship and it wasnot until the fifth that the lock burst in sunder and the wreckof the door fell inwards on the carpetThe besiegers appalled by their own riot and the stillness thathad succeeded stood back a little and peered in There lay thecabinet before their eyes in the quiet lamplight a good fireglowing and chattering on the hearth the kettle singing its thinstrain a drawer or two open papers neatly set forth on thebusinesstable and nearer the fire the things laid out for teathe quietest room you would have said and but for the glazedpresses full of chemicals the most commonplace that night inLondonRight in the midst there lay the body of a man sorely contortedand still twitching They drew near on tiptoe turned it on itsback and beheld the face of Edward Hyde He was dressed inclothes far too large for him clothes of the doctors bignessthe cords of his face still moved with a semblance of life butlife was quite gone and by the crushed phial in the hand and thestrong smell of kernels that hung upon the air Utterson knewthat he was looking on the body of a selfdestroyerWe have come too late he said sternly whether to save orpunish Hyde is gone to his account and it only remains for usto find the body of your masterThe far greater proportion of the building was occupied by thetheatre which filled almost the whole ground story and waslighted from above and by the cabinet which formed an upperstory at one end and looked upon thecourt A corridor joined the theatre to the door on thebystreet and with this the cabinet communicated separately by asecond flight of stairs There were besides a few dark closetsand a spacious cellar All these they now thoroughly examinedEach closet needed but a glance for all were empty and all bythe dust that fell from their doors had stood long unopened Thecellar indeed was filled with crazy lumber mostly dating fromthe times of the surgeon who was Jekylls predecessor but evenas they opened the door they were advertised of the uselessnessof further search by the fall of a perfect mat of cobweb whichhad for years sealed up the entrance Nowhere was there any traceof Henry Jekyll dead or alivePoole stamped on the flags of the corridor He must be buriedhere he said hearkening to the soundOr he may have fled said Utterson and he turned to examinethe door in the bystreet It was locked and lying near by onthe flags they found the key already stained with rustThis does not look like use observed the lawyerUse echoed Poole Do you not see sir it is broken much asif a man had stamped on itAy continued Utterson and the fractures too are rustyThe two men looked at each other with a scare This is beyondmePoole said the lawyer Let us go back to the cabinetThey mounted the stair in silence and still with an occasionalawestruck glance at the dead body proceeded more thoroughly toexamine the contents of the cabinet At one table there weretraces of chemical work various measured heaps of some whitesalt being laid on glass saucers as though for an experiment inwhich the unhappy man had been preventedThat is the same drug that I was always bringing him saidPoole and even as he spoke the kettle with a startling noiseboiled overThis brought them to the fireside where the easychair was drawncosily up and the teathings stood ready to the sitters elbowthe very sugar in the cup There were several books on a shelfone lay beside the teathings open and Utterson was amazed tofind it a copy of a pious work for which Jekyll had severaltimes expressed a great esteem annotated in his own hand withstartling blasphemiesNext in the course of their review of the chamber the searcherscame to the cheval glass into whose depths they looked with aninvoluntary horror But it was so turned as to show them nothingbut the rosy glow playing on the roof the fire sparkling in ahundred repetitions along the glazed front of the presses andtheir own pale and fearful countenances stooping to look inThis glass have seen some strange things sir whispered PooleAnd surely none stranger than itself echoed the lawyer in thesame tones For what did Jekyllhe caught himself up at theword with a start and then conquering the weaknesswhatcould Jekyll want with it he saidYou may say that said Poole Next they turned to thebusinesstable On the desk among the neat array of papers alarge envelope was uppermost and bore in the doctors hand thename of Mr Utterson The lawyer unsealed it and severalenclosures fell to the floor The first was a will drawn in thesame eccentric terms as the one which he had returned six monthsbefore to serve as a testament in case of death and as a deed ofgift in case of disappearance but in place of the name ofEdward Hyde the lawyer with indescribable amazement read thename of Gabriel John Utterson He looked at Poole and then backat the paper and last of all at the dead malefactor stretchedupon the carpetMy head goes round he said He has been all these days inpossession he had no cause to like me he must have raged to seehimself displaced and he has not destroyed this documentHe caught up the next paper it was a brief note in the doctorshand and dated at the topO Poole the lawyer cried he was alive and here this day Hecannot have been disposed of in so short a space he must bestill alive he must have fled And then why fled and how andin that case can we venture to declare this suicide Oh we mustbe careful I foresee that we may yet involve your master in somedire catastropheWhy dont you read it sir asked PooleBecause I fear replied the lawyer solemnly God grant I haveno cause for it And with that he brought the paper to his eyesand read as followsMY DEAR UTTERSONWhen this shall fall into your hands Ishall have disappeared under what circumstances I have not thepenetration to foresee but my instinct and all the circumstancesof my nameless situation tell me that the end is sure and must beearly Go then and first read the narrative which Lanyon warnedme he was to place in your hands and if you care to hear moreturn to the confession of                  Your unworthy and unhappy friend                                        HENRY JEKYLLThere was a third enclosure asked UttersonHere sir said Poole and gave into his hands a considerablepacket sealed in several placesThe lawyer put it in his pocket I would say nothing of thispaper If your master has fled or is dead we may at least savehis credit It is now ten I must go home and read thesedocuments in quiet but I shall be back before midnight when weshall send for the policeThey went out locking the door of the theatre behind them andUtterson once more leaving the servants gathered about the firein the hall trudged back to his office to read the twonarratives in which this mystery was now to be explained                          DR LANYONS NARRATIVEON the ninth of January now four days ago I received by theevening delivery a registered envelope addressed in the hand ofmy colleague and old schoolcompanion Henry Jekyll I was a gooddeal surprised by this for we were by no means in the habit ofcorrespondence I had seen the man dined with him indeed thenight before and I could imagine nothing in our intercourse thatshould justify formality of registration The contents increasedmy wonder for this is how the letter ran                                 th December DEAR LANYON You are one of my oldest friends and although wemay have differed at times on scientific questions I cannotremember at least on my side any break in our affection Therewas never a day when if you had said to me Jekyll my life myhonour my reason depend upon you I would not have sacrificedmy left hand to help you Lanyon my life my honour my reasonare all at your mercyif you fail me tonight I am lost You might suppose after thispreface that I am going to ask you for something dishonourableto grant Judge for yourselfI want you to postpone all other engagements for tonightayeven if you were summoned to the bedside of an emperor to take acab unless your carriage should be actually at the door andwith this letter in your hand for consultation to drive straightto my house Poole my butler has his orders you will find himwaiting your arrival with a locksmith The door of my cabinet isthen to be forced and you are to go in alone to open the glazedpress letter E on the left hand breaking the lock if it beshut and to draw out with all its contents as they stand thefourth drawer from the top or which is the same thing the thirdfrom the bottom In my extreme distress of wind I have a morbidfear of misdirecting you but even if I am in error you may knowthe right drawer by its contents some powders a phial and apaper book This drawer I beg of you to carry back with you toCavendish Square exactly as it standsThat is the first part of the service now for the second Youshould be back if you set out at once on the receipt of thislong before midnight but I will leave you that amount of marginnot only in the fear of one of those obstacles that can neitherbe prevented nor foreseen but because an hour when your servants are in bed is to bepreferred for what will then remain to do At midnight then Ihave to ask you to be alone in your consultingroom to admitwith your own hand into the house a man who will present himselfin my name and to place in his hands the drawer that you willhave brought with you from my cabinet Then you will have playedyour part and earned my gratitude completely Five minutesafterwards if you insist upon an explanation you will haveunderstood that these arrangements are of capital importance andthat by the neglect of one of them fantastic as they mustappear you might have charged your conscience with my death orthe shipwreck of my reasonConfident as I am that you will not trifle with this appeal myheart sinks and my hand trembles at the bare thought of such apossibility Think of me at this hour in a strange placelabouring under a blackness of distress that no fancy canexaggerate and yet well aware that if you will but punctuallyserve me my troubles will roll away like a story that is toldServe me my dear Lanyon and save                                       Your friend                                            H JP S I had already sealed this up when a fresh terror struckupon my soul It is possible that the postoffice may fail me andthis letternot come into your hands until tomorrow morning In that casedear Lanyon do my errand when it shall be most convenient foryou in the course of the day and once more expect my messengerat midnight It may then already be too late and if that nightpasses without event you will know that you have seen the lastof Henry JekyllUpon the reading of this letter I made sure my colleague wasinsane but till that was proved beyond the possibility of doubtI felt bound to do as he requested The less I understood of thisfarrago the less I was in a position to judge of its importanceand an appeal so worded could not be set aside without a graveresponsibility I rose accordingly from table got into a hansomand drove straight to Jekylls house The butler was awaiting myarrival he had received by the same post as mine a registeredletter of instruction and had sent at once for a locksmith and acarpenter The tradesmen came while we were yet speaking and wemoved in a body to old Dr Denmans surgical theatre from whichas you are doubtless aware Jekylls private cabinet is mostconveniently entered The door was very strong the lockexcellent the carpenter avowed he would have great trouble andhave to do much damage if force were to be used and thelocksmith was near despair But this last was a handy fellowand after two hours work the door stood open The press markedE was unlocked and I took out the drawer had it filled up withstraw and tied in a sheet and returned with it to CavendishSquareHere I proceeded to examine its contents The powders were neatlyenough made up but not with the nicety of the dispensingchemist so that it was plain they were of Jekylls privatemanufacture and when I opened one of the wrappers I found whatseemed to me a simple crystalline salt of a white colour Thephial to which I next turned my attention might have been abouthalffull of a bloodred liquor which was highly pungent to thesense of smell and seemed to me to contain phosphorus and somevolatile ether At the other ingredients I could make no guessThe book was an ordinary versionbook and contained little but aseries of dates These covered a period of many years but Iobserved that the entries ceased nearly a year ago and quiteabruptly Here and there a brief remark was appended to a dateusually no more than a single word double occurring perhapssix times in a total of several hundred entries and once veryearly in the list and followed by several marks of exclamationtotal failure All this though it whetted my curiosity toldme little that was definite Here were a phial of some tincturea paper of some salt and the record of a series of experiments that had led like too many of Jekylls investigations tono end of practical usefulness How could the presence of thesearticles in my house affect either the honour the sanity or thelife of my flighty colleague If his messenger could go to oneplace why could he not go to another And even granting someimpediment why was this gentleman to be received by me insecret The more I reflected the more convinced I grew that I wasdealing with a case of cerebral disease and though I dismissedmy servants to bed I loaded an old revolver that I might befound in some posture of selfdefenceTwelve oclock had scarce rung out over London ere the knockersounded very gently on the door I went myself at the summonsand found a small man crouching against the pillars of theporticoAre you come from Dr Jekyll I askedHe told me yes by a constrained gesture and when I had biddenhim enter he did not obey me without a searching backward glanceinto the darkness of the square There was a policeman not faroff advancing with his bulls eye open and at the sight Ithought my visitor started and made greater hasteThese particulars struck me I confess disagreeably and as Ifollowed him into the bright light of the consultingroom I keptmy hand ready on my weapon Here at last I had achance of clearly seeing him I had never set eyes on him beforeso much was certain He was small as I have said I was struckbesides with the shocking expression of his face with hisremarkable combination of great muscular activity and greatapparent debility of constitution andlast but not leastwith the odd subjective disturbance caused by his neighbourhoodThis bore some resemblance to incipient rigour and wasaccompanied by a marked sinking of the pulse At the time I setit down to some idiosyncratic personal distaste and merelywondered at the acuteness of the symptoms but I have since hadreason to believe the cause to lie much deeper in the nature ofman and to turn on some nobler hinge than the principle ofhatredThis person who had thus from the first moment of his entrancestruck in me what I can only describe as a disgustful curiositywas dressed in a fashion that would have made an ordinary personlaughable his clothes that is to say although they were ofrich and sober fabric were enormously too large for him in everymeasurementthe trousers hanging on his legs and rolled up tokeep them from the ground the waist of the coat below hishaunches and the collar sprawling wide upon his shouldersStrange to relate this ludicrous accoutrement was far frommoving me to laughter Rather as there was something abnormaland misbegotten in the very essence of the creature that now faced mesomething seizing surprising and revoltingthis freshdisparity seemed but to fit in with and to reinforce it so thatto my interest in the mans nature and character there was addeda curiosity as to his origin his life his fortune and status inthe worldThese observations though they have taken so great a space to beset down in were yet the work of a few seconds My visitor wasindeed on fire with sombre excitementHave you got it he cried Have you got it And so lively washis impatience that he even laid his hand upon my arm and soughtto shake meI put him back conscious at his touch of a certain icy pangalong my blood Come sir said I You forget that I have notyet the pleasure of your acquaintance Be seated if you pleaseAnd I showed him an example and sat down myself in my customaryseat and with as fair an imitation of my ordinary manner to apatient as the lateness of the hour the nature of mypreoccupations and the horror I had of my visitor would sufferme to musterI beg your pardon Dr Lanyon he replied civilly enough Whatyou say is very well founded and my impatience has shown itsheels to my politeness I come here at the instance of yourcolleague Dr Henry Jekyll on a piece of business of somemoment and I understood He paused and put his hand to his throat and I couldsee in spite of his collected manner that he was wrestlingagainst the approaches of the hysteriaI understood adrawerBut here I took pity on my visitors suspense and some perhapson my own growing curiosityThere it is sir said I pointing to the drawer where it layon the floor behind a table and still covered with the sheetHe sprang to it and then paused and laid his hand upon hisheart I could hear his teeth grate with the convulsive action ofhis jaws and his face was so ghastly to see that I grew alarmedboth for his life and reasonCompose yourself said IHe turned a dreadful smile to me and as if with the decision ofdespair plucked away the sheet At sight of the contents heuttered one loud sob of such immense relief that I sat petrifiedAnd the next moment in a voice that was already fairly wellunder control Have you a graduated glass he askedI rose from my place with something of an effort and gave himwhat he askedHe thanked me with a smiling nod measured out a few minims ofthe red tincture and added one of the powders The mixture whichwas at first of a reddish hue began in proportion as thecrystals melted to brighten in colour to effervesce audiblyand to throw off smallfumes of vapour Suddenly and at the same moment the ebullitionceased and the compound changed to a dark purple which fadedagain more slowly to a watery green My visitor who had watchedthese metamorphoses with a keen eye smiled set down the glassupon the table and then turned and looked upon me with an air ofscrutinyAnd now said he to settle what remains Will you be wisewill you be guided will you suffer me to take this glass in myhand and to go forth from your house without further parley orhas the greed of curiosity too much command of you Think beforeyou answer for it shall be done as you decide As you decideyou shall be left as you were before and neither richer norwiser unless the sense of service rendered to a man in mortaldistress may be counted as a kind of riches of the soul Or ifyou shall so prefer to choose a new province of knowledge andnew avenues to fame and power shall be laid open to you here inthis room upon the instant and your sight shall be blasted by aprodigy to stagger the unbelief of SatanSir said I affecting a coolness that I was far from trulypossessing you speak enigmas and you will perhaps not wonderthat I hear you with no very strong impression of belief But Ihave gone too far in the way of inexplicable services to pausebefore I see the endIt is well replied my visitor Lanyonyou remember your vows what follows is under the seal of ourprofession And now you who have so long been bound to the mostnarrow and material views you who have denied the virtue oftranscendental medicine you who have derided your superiorsbeholdHe put the glass to his lips and drank at one gulp A cryfollowed he reeled staggered clutched at the table and heldon staring with injected eyes gasping with open mouth and as Ilooked there came I thought a changehe seemed to swellhis face became suddenly black and the features seemed to meltand alterand the next moment I had sprung to my feet andleaped back against the wall my arm raised to shield me fromthat prodigy my mind submerged in terrorO God I screamed and O God again and again for therebefore my eyespale and shaken and halffainting and gropingbefore him with his hands like a man restored from deaththere stood Henry JekyllWhat he told me in the next hour I cannot bring my mind to seton paper I saw what I saw I heard what I heard and my soulsickened at it and yet now when that sight has faded from myeyes I ask myself if I believe it and I cannot answer My lifeis shaken to its roots sleep has left me the deadliest terrorsits by me at all hours of the day and night I feel that my daysare numbered and that Imust die and yet I shall die incredulous As for the moralturpitude that man unveiled to me even with tears of penitenceI cannot even in memory dwell on it without a start of horrorI will say but one thing Utterson and that if you can bringyour mind to credit it will be more than enough The creaturewho crept into my house that night was on Jekylls ownconfession known by the name of Hyde and hunted for in everycorner of the land as the murderer of Carew                                               HASTIE LANYON                HENRY JEKYLLS FULL STATEMENT OF THE CASEI WAS born in the year  to a large fortune endowed besideswith excellent parts inclined by nature to industry fond of therespect of the wise and good among my fellowmen and thus asmight have been supposed with every guarantee of an honourableand distinguished future And indeed the worst of my faults was acertain impatient gaiety of disposition such as has made thehappiness of many but such as I found it hard to reconcile withmy imperious desire to carry my head high and wear a more thancommonly grave countenance before the public Hence it came aboutthat I concealed my pleasures and that when I reached years ofreflection and began to look round me and take stock of myprogress and position in the world I stood already committed toa profound duplicity of life Many a man would have even blazonedsuch irregularities as I was guilty of but from the high viewsthat I had set before me I regarded and hid them with an almostmorbid sense of shame It was thus rather the exactingnature of my aspirations than any particular degradation in myfaults that made me what I was and with even a deeper trenchthan in the majority of men severed in me those provinces ofgood and ill which divide and compound mans dual nature In thiscase I was driven to reflect deeply and inveterately on thathard law of life which lies at the root of religion and is oneof the most plentiful springs of distress Though so profound adoubledealer I was in no sense a hypocrite both sides of mewere in dead earnest I was no more myself when I laid asiderestraint and plunged in shame than when I laboured in the eyeof day at the furtherance of knowledge or the relief of sorrowand suffering And it chanced that the direction of my scientificstudies which led wholly toward the mystic and thetranscendental reacted and shed a strong light on thisconsciousness of the perennial war among my members With everyday and from both sides of my intelligence the moral and theintellectual I thus drew steadily nearer to that truth by whosepartial discovery I have been doomed to such a dreadfulshipwreck that man is not truly one but truly two I say twobecause the state of my own knowledge does not pass beyond thatpoint Others will follow others will outstrip me on the samelines and I hazard the guess that man will be ultimately knownfor a mere polity of multifarious incongruous and independentdenizens I for mypart from the nature of my life advanced infallibly in onedirection and in one direction only It was on the moral sideand in my own person that I learned to recognise the thoroughand primitive duality of man I saw that of the two natures thatcontended in the field of my consciousness even if I couldrightly be said to be either it was only because I was radicallyboth and from an early date even before the course of myscientific discoveries had begun to suggest the most nakedpossibility of such a miracle I had learned to dwell withpleasure as a beloved daydream on the thought of theseparation of these elements If each I told myself could butbe housed in separate identities life would be relieved of allthat was unbearable the unjust delivered from the aspirationsmight go his way and remorse of his more upright twin and thejust could walk steadfastly and securely on his upward pathdoing the good things in which he found his pleasure and nolonger exposed to disgrace and penitence by the hands of thisextraneous evil It was the curse of mankind that theseincongruous fagots were thus bound together that in the agonisedwomb of consciousness these polar twins should be continuouslystruggling How then were they dissociatedI was so far in my reflections when as I have said a sidelightbegan to shine upon the subject from the laboratory table Ibegan to perceivemore deeply than it has ever yet been stated the tremblingimmateriality the mistlike transience of this seemingly sosolid body in which we walk attired Certain agents I found tohave the power to shake and to pluck back that fleshly vestmenteven as a wind might toss the curtains of a pavilion For twogood reasons I will not enter deeply into this scientific branchof my confession First because I have been made to learn thatthe doom and burthen of our life is bound for ever on mansshoulders and when the attempt is made to cast it off it butreturns upon us with more unfamiliar and more awful pressureSecond because as my narrative will make alas too evident mydiscoveries were incomplete Enough then that I not onlyrecognised my natural body for the mere aura and effulgence ofcertain of the powers that made up my spirit but managed tocompound a drug by which these powers should be dethroned fromtheir supremacy and a second form and countenance substitutednone the less natural to me because they were the expression andbore the stamp of lower elements in my soulI hesitated long before I put this theory to the test ofpractice I knew well that I risked death for any drug that sopotently controlled and shook the very fortress of identitymight by the least scruple of an overdose or at the leastinopportunity in the moment of exhibition utterly blot out thatimmaterial tabernacle which Ilooked to it to change But the temptation of a discovery sosingular and profound at last overcame the suggestions of alarmI had long since prepared my tincture I purchased at once froma firm of wholesale chemists a large quantity of a particularsalt which I knew from my experiments to be the last ingredientrequired and late one accursed night I compounded the elementswatched them boil and smoke together in the glass and when theebullition had subsided with a strong glow of courage drank offthe potionThe most racking pangs succeeded a grinding in the bones deadlynausea and a horror of the spirit that cannot be exceeded at thehour of birth or death Then these agonies began swiftly tosubside and I came to myself as if out of a great sicknessThere was something strange in my sensations somethingindescribably new and from its very novelty incredibly sweet Ifelt younger lighter happier in body within I was conscious ofa heady recklessness a current of disordered sensual imagesrunning like a millrace in my fancy a solution of the bonds ofobligation an unknown but not an innocent freedom of the soul Iknew myself at the first breath of this new life to be morewicked tenfold more wicked sold a slave to my original eviland the thought in that moment braced and delighted me likewine I stretched out my hands exulting in the freshness ofthesesensations and in the act I was suddenly aware that I had lostin statureThere was no mirror at that date in my room that which standsbeside me as I write was brought there later on and for the verypurpose of these transformations The night however was fargone into the morningthe morning black as it was was nearlyripe for the conception of the daythe inmates of my housewere locked in the most rigorous hours of slumber and Idetermined flushed as I was with hope and triumph to venture inmy new shape as far as to my bedroom I crossed the yard whereinthe constellations looked down upon me I could have thoughtwith wonder the first creature of that sort that theirunsleeping vigilance had yet disclosed to them I stole throughthe corridors a stranger in my own house and coming to my roomI saw for the first time the appearance of Edward HydeI must here speak by theory alone saying not that which I knowbut that which I suppose to be most probable The evil side of mynature to which I had now transferred the stamping efficacy wasless robust and less developed than the good which I had justdeposed Again in the course of my life which had been afterall ninetenths a life of effort virtue and control it hadbeen much less exercised and much less exhausted And hence as Ithink it came about that Edward Hyde was so much smallerslighter and younger than Henry Jekyll Even as good shone uponthe countenance of the one evil was written broadly and plainlyon the face of the other Evil besides which I must stillbelieve to be the lethal side of man had left on that body animprint of deformity and decay And yet when I looked upon thatugly idol in the glass I was conscious of no repugnance ratherof a leap of welcome This too was myself It seemed naturaland human In my eyes it bore a livelier image of the spirit itseemed more express and single than the imperfect and dividedcountenance I had been hitherto accustomed to call mine And inso far I was doubtless right I have observed that when I worethe semblance of Edward Hyde none could come near to me at firstwithout a visible misgiving of the flesh This as I take it wasbecause all human beings as we meet them are commingled out ofgood and evil and Edward Hyde alone in the ranks of mankindwas pure evilI lingered but a moment at the mirror the second and conclusiveexperiment had yet to be attempted it yet remained to be seen ifI had lost my identity beyond redemption and must flee beforedaylight from a house that was no longer mine and hurrying backto my cabinet I once more prepared and drank the cup once moresuffered the pangs of dissolution and came to myself once morewith the character the stature and the face of Henry JekyllThat night I had come to the fatal crossroads Had I approachedmy discovery in a more noble spirit had I risked the experimentwhile under the empire of generous or pious aspirations all musthave been otherwise and from these agonies of death and birth Ihad come forth an angel instead of a fiend The drug had nodiscriminating action it was neither diabolical nor divine itbut shook the doors of the prisonhouse of my disposition andlike the captives of Philippi that which stood within ran forthAt that time my virtue slumbered my evil kept awake byambition was alert and swift to seize the occasion and thething that was projected was Edward Hyde Hence although I hadnow two characters as well as two appearances one was whollyevil and the other was still the old Henry Jekyll thatincongruous compound of whose reformation and improvement I hadalready learned to despair The movement was thus wholly towardthe worseEven at that time I had not yet conquered my aversion to thedryness of a life of study I would still be merrily disposed attimes and as my pleasures were to say the least undignifiedand I was not only well known and highly considered but growingtoward the elderly man this incoherency of my life was dailygrowing more unwelcome It was on this side that my new powertempted me until I fell in slavery I had but to drink the cupto doff at once the bodyof the noted professor and to assume like a thick cloak thatof Edward Hyde I smiled at the notion it seemed to me at thetime to be humorous and I made my preparations with the moststudious care I took and furnished that house in Soho to whichHyde was tracked by the police and engaged as housekeeper acreature whom I well knew to be silent and unscrupulous On theother side I announced to my servants that a Mr Hyde whom Idescribed was to have full liberty and power about my house inthe square and to parry mishaps I even called and made myself afamiliar object in my second character I next drew up that willto which you so much objected so that if anything befell me inthe person of Dr Jekyll I could enter on that of Edward Hydewithout pecuniary loss And thus fortified as I supposed onevery side I began to profit by the strange immunities of mypositionMen have before hired bravos to transact their crimes whiletheir own person and reputation sat under shelter I was thefirst that ever did so for his pleasures I was the first thatcould thus plod in the public eye with a load of genialrespectability and in a moment like a schoolboy strip offthese lendings and spring headlong into the sea of liberty Butfor me in my impenetrable mantle the safety was complete Thinkof itI did not even exist Let me but escape into mylaboratory door give me but a second ortwo to mix and swallow the draught that I had always standingready and whatever he had done Edward Hyde would pass away likethe stain of breath upon a mirror and there in his steadquietly at home trimming the midnight lamp in his study a manwho could afford to laugh at suspicion would be Henry JekyllThe pleasures which I made haste to seek in my disguise were asI have said undignified I would scarce use a harder term Butin the hands of Edward Hyde they soon began to turn toward themonstrous When I would come back from these excursions I wasoften plunged into a kind of wonder at my vicarious depravityThis familiar that I called out of my own soul and sent forthalone to do his good pleasure was a being inherently malign andvillainous his every act and thought centred on self drinkingpleasure with bestial avidity from any degree of torture toanother relentless like a man of stone Henry Jekyll stood attimes aghast before the acts of Edward Hyde but the situationwas apart from ordinary laws and insidiously relaxed the graspof conscience It was Hyde after all and Hyde alone that wasguilty Jekyll was no worse he woke again to his good qualitiesseemingly unimpaired he would even make haste where it waspossible to undo the evil done by Hyde And thus his conscienceslumberedInto the details of the infamy at which I thusconnived for even now I can scarce grant that I committed it Ihave no design of entering I mean but to point out the warningsand the successive steps with which my chastisement approached Imet with one accident which as it brought on no consequence Ishall no more than mention An act of cruelty to a child arousedagainst me the anger of a passerby whom I recognised the otherday in the person of your kinsman the doctor and the childsfamily joined him there were moments when I feared for my lifeand at last in order to pacify their too just resentment EdwardHyde had to bring them to the door and pay them in a chequedrawn in the name of Henry Jekyll But this danger was easilyeliminated from the future by opening an account at another bankin the name of Edward Hyde himself and when by sloping my ownhand backward I had supplied my double with a signature Ithought I sat beyond the reach of fateSome two months before the murder of Sir Danvers I had been outfor one of my adventures had returned at a late hour and wokethe next day in bed with somewhat odd sensations It was in vainI looked about me in vain I saw the decent furniture and tallproportions of my room in the square in vain that I recognisedthe pattern of the bedcurtains and the design of the mahoganyframe something still kept insisting that I was not where I wasthat I had not wakened where I seemed to be but in the littleroom in Soho where I was accustomed to sleep in the body ofEdward Hyde I smiled to myself and in my psychological waybegan lazily to inquire into the elements of this illusionoccasionally even as I did so dropping back into a comfortablemorning doze I was still so engaged when in one of my morewakeful moments my eyes fell upon my hand Now the hand of HenryJekyll as you have often remarked was professional in shape andsize it was large firm white and comely But the hand which Inow saw clearly enough in the yellow light of a midLondonmorning lying half shut on the bedclothes was lean cordedknuckly of a dusky pallor and thickly shaded with a swart growthof hair It was the hand of Edward HydeI must have stared upon it for near half a minute sunk as I wasin the mere stupidity of wonder before terror woke up in mybreast as sudden and startling as the crash of cymbals andbounding from my bed I rushed to the mirror At the sight thatmet my eyes my blood was changed into something exquisitely thinand icy Yes I had gone to bed Henry Jekyll I had awakenedEdward Hyde How was this to be explained I asked myself andthen with another bound of terrorhow was it to be remediedIt was well on in the morning the servants were up all my drugswere in thecabineta long journey down two pairs of stairs through theback passage across the open court and through the anatomicaltheatre from where I was then standing horrorstruck It mightindeed be possible to cover my face but of what use was thatwhen I was unable to conceal the alteration in my stature Andthen with an overpowering sweetness of relief it came back uponmy mind that the servants were already used to the coming andgoing of my second self I had soon dressed as well as I wasable in clothes of my own size had soon passed through thehouse where Bradshaw stared and drew back at seeing Mr Hyde atsuch an hour and in such a strange array and ten minutes laterDr Jekyll had returned to his own shape and was sitting downwith a darkened brow to make a feint of breakfastingSmall indeed was my appetite This inexplicable incident thisreversal of my previous experience seemed like the Babylonianfinger on the wall to be spelling out the letters of myjudgment and I began to reflect more seriously than ever beforeon the issues and possibilities of my double existence That partof me which I had the power of projecting had lately been muchexercised and nourished it had seemed to me of late as thoughthe body of Edward Hyde had grown in stature as though when Iwore that form I were conscious of a more generous tide ofblood and I began to spy a danger thatif this were much prolonged the balance of my nature might bepermanently overthrown the power of voluntary change beforfeited and the character of Edward Hyde become irrevocablymine The power of the drug had not been always equallydisplayed Once very early in my career it had totally failedme since then I had been obliged on more than one occasion todouble and once with infinite risk of death to treble theamount and these rare uncertainties had cast hitherto the soleshadow on my contentment Now however and in the light of thatmornings accident I was led to remark that whereas in thebeginning the difficulty had been to throw off the body ofJekyll it had of late gradually but decidedly transferred itselfto the other side All things therefore seemed to point to thisthat I was slowly losing hold of my original and better self andbecoming slowly incorporated with my second and worseBetween these two I now felt I had to choose My two natures hadmemory in common but all other faculties were most unequallyshared between them Jekyll who was composite now with the mostsensitive apprehensions now with a greedy gusto projected andshared in the pleasures and adventures of Hyde but Hyde wasindifferent to Jekyll or but remembered him as the mountainbandit remembers the cavern in which he conceals himself frompursuit Jekyll had more than a fathers interest Hydehad more than a sons indifference To cast in my lot withJekyll was to die to those appetites which I had long secretlyindulged and had of late begun to pamper To cast it in withHyde was to die to a thousand interests and aspirations and tobecome at a blow and for ever despised and friendless Thebargain might appear unequal but there was still anotherconsideration in the scales for while Jekyll would suffersmartingly in the fires of abstinence Hyde would be not evenconscious of all that he had lost Strange as my circumstanceswere the terms of this debate are as old and commonplace as manmuch the same inducements and alarms cast the die for any temptedand trembling sinner and it fell out with me as it falls withso vast a majority of my fellows that I chose the better partand was found wanting in the strength to keep to itYes I preferred the elderly and discontented doctor surroundedby friends and cherishing honest hopes and bade a resolutefarewell to the liberty the comparative youth the light stepleaping impulses and secret pleasures that I had enjoyed in thedisguise of Hyde I made this choice perhaps with someunconscious reservation for I neither gave up the house in Sohonor destroyed the clothes of Edward Hyde which still lay readyin my cabinet For two months however I was true to mydetermination for two months I led a life of suchseverity as I had never before attained to and enjoyed thecompensations of an approving conscience But time began at lastto obliterate the freshness of my alarm the praises ofconscience began to grow into a thing of course I began to betortured with throes and longings as of Hyde struggling afterfreedom and at last in an hour of moral weakness I once againcompounded and swallowed the transforming draughtI do not suppose that when a drunkard reasons with himself uponhis vice he is once out of five hundred times affected by thedangers that he runs through his brutish physical insensibilityneither had I long as I had considered my position made enoughallowance for the complete moral insensibility and insensatereadiness to evil which were the leading characters of EdwardHyde Yet it was by these that I was punished My devil had beenlong caged he came out roaring I was conscious even when Itook the draught of a more unbridled a more furious propensityto ill It must have been this I suppose that stirred in mysoul that tempest of impatience with which I listened to thecivilities of my unhappy victim I declare at least before Godno man morally sane could have been guilty of that crime upon sopitiful a provocation and that I struck in no more reasonablespirit than that in which a sick child may break a plaything ButI had voluntarily stripped myself of all those balancinginstinctsby which even the worst of us continues to walk with some degreeof steadiness among temptations and in my case to be temptedhowever slightly was to fallInstantly the spirit of hell awoke in me and raged With atransport of glee I mauled the unresisting body tasting delightfrom every blow and it was not till weariness had begun tosucceed that I was suddenly in the top fit of my deliriumstruck through the heart by a cold thrill of terror A mistdispersed I saw my life to be forfeit and fled from the sceneof these excesses at once glorying and trembling my lust ofevil gratified and stimulated my love of life screwed to thetopmost peg I ran to the house in Soho and to make assurancedoubly sure destroyed my papers thence I set out through thelamplit streets in the same divided ecstasy of mind gloating onmy crime lightheadedly devising others in the future and yetstill hastening and still hearkening in my wake for the steps ofthe avenger Hyde had a song upon his lips as he compounded thedraught and as he drank it pledged the dead man The pangs oftransformation had not done tearing him before Henry Jekyllwith streaming tears of gratitude and remorse had fallen uponhis knees and lifted his clasped hands to God The veil ofselfindulgence was rent from head to foot I saw my life as awhole I followed it up from the days of childhood when I hadwalkedwith my fathers hand and through the selfdenying toils of myprofessional life to arrive again and again with the same senseof unreality at the damned horrors of the evening I could havescreamed aloud I sought with tears and prayers to smother downthe crowd of hideous images and sounds with which my memoryswarmed against me and still between the petitions the uglyface of my iniquity stared into my soul As the acuteness of thisremorse began to die away it was succeeded by a sense of joyThe problem of my conduct was solved Hyde was thenceforthimpossible whether I would or not I was now confined to thebetter part of my existence and oh how I rejoiced to think itwith what willing humility I embraced anew the restrictions ofnatural life with what sincere renunciation I locked the doorby which I had so often gone and come and ground the key undermy heelThe next day came the news that the murder had been overlookedthat the guilt of Hyde was patent to the world and that thevictim was a man high in public estimation It was not only acrime it had been a tragic folly I think I was glad to know itI think I was glad to have my better impulses thus buttressed andguarded by the terrors of the scaffold Jekyll was now my city ofrefuge let but Hyde peep out an instant and the hands of allmen would be raised to take and slay himI resolved in my future conduct to redeem the past and I can saywith honesty that my resolve was fruitful of some good You knowyourself how earnestly in the last months of last year Ilaboured to relieve suffering you know that much was done forothers and that the days passed quietly almost happily formyself Nor can I truly say that I wearied of this beneficent andinnocent life I think instead that I daily enjoyed it morecompletely but I was still cursed with my duality of purposeand as the first edge of my penitence wore off the lower side ofme so long indulged so recently chained down began to growlfor licence Not that I dreamed of resuscitating Hyde the bareidea of that would startle me to frenzy no it was in my ownperson that I was once more tempted to trifle with myconscience and it was as an ordinary secret sinner that I atlast fell before the assaults of temptationThere comes an end to all things the most capacious measure isfilled at last and this brief condescension to evil finallydestroyed the balance of my soul And yet I was not alarmed thefall seemed natural like a return to the old days before I hadmade discovery It was a fine clear January day wet under footwhere the frost had melted but cloudless overhead and theRegents Park was full of winter chirrupings and sweet withspring odours I sat in the sun on a bench the animal within melicking thechops of memory the spiritual side a little drowsed promisingsubsequent penitence but not yet moved to begin After all Ireflected I was like my neighbours and then I smiled comparingmyself with other men comparing my active goodwill with the lazycruelty of their neglect And at the very moment of thatvainglorious thought a qualm came over me a horrid nausea andthe most deadly shuddering These passed away and left me faintand then as in its turn the faintness subsided I began to beaware of a change in the temper of my thoughts a greaterboldness a contempt of danger a solution of the bonds ofobligation I looked down my clothes hung formlessly on myshrunken limbs the hand that lay on my knee was corded andhairy I was once more Edward Hyde A moment before I had beensafe of all mens respect wealthy belovedthe cloth layingfor me in the diningroom at home and now I was the commonquarry of mankind hunted houseless a known murderer thrall tothe gallowsMy reason wavered but it did not fail me utterly I have morethan once observed that in my second character my facultiesseemed sharpened to a point and my spirits more tensely elasticthus it came about that where Jekyll perhaps might havesuccumbed Hyde rose to the importance of the moment My drugswere in one of the presses of my cabinet how was Ito reach them That was the problem that crushing my temples inmy hands I set myself to solve The laboratory door I hadclosed If I sought to enter by the house my own servants wouldconsign me to the gallows I saw I must employ another hand andthought of Lanyon How was he to be reached how persuadedSupposing that I escaped capture in the streets how was I tomake my way into his presence and how should I an unknown anddispleasing visitor prevail on the famous physician to rifle thestudy of his colleague Dr Jekyll Then I remembered that of myoriginal character one part remained to me I could write my ownhand and once I had conceived that kindling spark the way thatI must follow became lighted up from end to end Thereupon I arranged my clothes as best I could and summoninga passing hansom drove to an hotel in Portland Street the nameof which I chanced to remember At my appearance which wasindeed comical enough however tragic a fate these garmentscovered the driver could not conceal his mirth I gnashed myteeth upon him with a gust of devilish fury and the smilewithered from his facehappily for himyet more happily formyself for in another instant I had certainly dragged him fromhis perch At the inn as I entered I looked about me with soblack a countenance as made the attendants tremble not a lookdid they exchange in mypresence but obsequiously took my orders led me to a privateroom and brought me wherewithal to write Hyde in danger of hislife was a creature new to me shaken with inordinate angerstrung to the pitch of murder lusting to inflict pain Yet thecreature was astute mastered his fury with a great effort of thewill composed his two important letters one to Lanyon and oneto Poole and that he might receive actual evidence of theirbeing posted sent them out with directions that they should beregisteredThenceforward he sat all day over the fire in the private roomgnawing his nails there he dined sitting alone with his fearsthe waiter visibly quailing before his eye and thence when thenight was fully come he set forth in the corner of a closed caband was driven to and fro about the streets of the city He IsayI cannot say I That child of Hell had nothing humannothing lived in him but fear and hatred And when at lastthinking the driver had begun to grow suspicious he dischargedthe cab and ventured on foot attired in his misfitting clothesan object marked out for observation into the midst of thenocturnal passengers these two base passions raged within himlike a tempest He walked fast hunted by his fears chatteringto himself skulking through the lessfrequented thoroughfarescounting the minutes that still divided him from midnight Once awoman spoke to him offering I think a box of lights He smoteher in the face and she fledWhen I came to myself at Lanyons the horror of my old friendperhaps affected me somewhat I do not know it was at least buta drop in the sea to the abhorrence with which I looked back uponthese hours A change had come over me It was no longer the fearof the gallows it was the horror of being Hyde that racked me Ireceived Lanyons condemnation partly in a dream it was partlyin a dream that I came home to my own house and got into bed Islept after the prostration of the day with a stringent andprofound slumber which not even the nightmares that wrung mecould avail to break I awoke in the morning shaken weakenedbut refreshed I still hated and feared the thought of the brutethat slept within me and I had not of course forgotten theappalling dangers of the day before but I was once more at homein my own house and close to my drugs and gratitude for myescape shone so strong in my soul that it almost rivalled thebrightness of hopeI was stepping leisurely across the court after breakfastdrinking the chill of the air with pleasure when I was seizedagain with those indescribable sensations that heralded thechange and I had but the time to gain the shelter of my cabinetbefore I was once again raging and freezing with the passions ofHyde It took on this occasion a double dose to recall me tomyself and alas Six hours after as I sat looking sadly in thefire the pangs returned and the drug had to be readministeredIn short from that day forth it seemed only by a great effort asof gymnastics and only under the immediate stimulation of thedrug that I was able to wear the countenance of Jekyll At allhours of the day and night I would be taken with the premonitoryshudder above all if I slept or even dozed for a moment in mychair it was always as Hyde that I awakened Under the strain ofthis continuallyimpending doom and by the sleeplessness to whichI now condemned myself ay even beyond what I had thoughtpossible to man I became in my own person a creature eaten upand emptied by fever languidly weak both in body and mind andsolely occupied by one thought the horror of my other self Butwhen I slept or when the virtue of the medicine wore off Iwould leap almost without transition for the pangs oftransformation grew daily less marked into the possession of afancy brimming with images of terror a soul boiling withcauseless hatreds and a body that seemed not strong enough tocontain the raging energies of life The powers of Hyde seemed tohave grown with the sickliness of Jekyll And certainly the hatethat now divided them was equal on each side With Jekyll it wasa thing of vital instinct He had now seen the full deformity ofthat creature that shared with him some of the phenomena ofconsciousness and was coheir with him to death and beyond theselinks of community which in themselves made the most poignantpart of his distress he thought of Hyde for all his energy oflife as of something not only hellish but inorganic This was theshocking thing that the slime of the pit seemed to utter criesand voices that the amorphous dust gesticulated and sinned thatwhat was dead and had no shape should usurp the offices of lifeAnd this again that that insurgent horror was knit to him closerthan a wife closer than an eye lay caged in his flesh where heheard it mutter and felt it struggle to be born and at every hourof weakness and in the confidence of slumber prevailed againsthim and deposed him out of life The hatred of Hyde for Jekyllwas of a different order His terror of the gallows drove himcontinually to commit temporary suicide and return to hissubordinate station of a part instead of a person but he loathedthe necessity he loathed the despondency into which Jekyll wasnow fallen and he resented the dislike with which he was himselfregarded Hence the apelike tricks that he would play mescrawling in my own hand blasphemies on the pages of my booksburning the letters and destroying the portrait of my father andindeed had it not been for his fear of death he would long agohave ruined himself in order to involve me in the ruin But hislove of life is wonderful I go further I who sickenand freeze at the mere thought of him when I recall theabjection and passion of this attachment and when I know how hefears my power to cut him off by suicide I find it in my heartto pity himIt is useless and the time awfully fails me to prolong thisdescription no one has ever suffered such torments let thatsuffice and yet even to these habit broughtno notalleviationbut a certain callousness of soul a certainacquiescence of despair and my punishment might have gone on foryears but for the last calamity which has now fallen and whichhas finally severed me from my own face and nature My provisionof the salt which had never been renewed since the date of thefirst experiment began to run low I sent out for a freshsupply and mixed the draught the ebullition followed and thefirst change of colour not the second I drank it and it waswithout efficiency You will learn from Poole how I have hadLondon ransacked it was in vain and I am now persuaded that myfirst supply was impure and that it was that unknown impuritywhich lent efficacy to the draughtAbout a week has passed and I am now finishing this statementunder the influence of the last of the old powders This thenis the last time short of a miracle that Henry Jekyll can thinkhis own thoughts or see his own face now how sadly alteredin the glass Nor must I delaytoo long to bring my writing to an end for if my narrative hashitherto escaped destruction it has been by a combination ofgreat prudence and great good luck Should the throes of changetake me in the act of writing it Hyde will tear it in piecesbut if some time shall have elapsed after I have laid it by hiswonderful selfishness and Circumscription to the moment willprobably save it once again from the action of his apelikespite And indeed the doom that is closing on us both hasalready changed and crushed him Half an hour from now when Ishall again and for ever reindue that hated personality I knowhow I shall sit shuddering and weeping in my chair or continuewith the most strained and fearstruck ecstasy of listening topace up and down this room my last earthly refuge and give earto every sound of menace Will Hyde die upon the scaffold orwill he find courage to release himself at the last moment Godknows I am careless this is my true hour of death and what isto follow concerns another than myself Here then as I lay downthe pen and proceed to seal up my confession I bring the life ofthat unhappy Henry Jekyll to an end
